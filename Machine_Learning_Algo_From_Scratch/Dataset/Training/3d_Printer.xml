  <row Id="12" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="2" CreationDate="2016-01-12T19:13:00.710" Score="10" Body="&lt;p&gt;There is very little information about safety available, as home 3D printers are relatively new. However, plastics such as ABS have a long history in making plastic products, and a study found that at traditional manufacturing methods (such as injection molding and hot wire cutting) &lt;a href=&quot;http://annhyg.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/3/399&quot;&gt;do not release dangerous levels of carcinogens and/or respiratory sensitizers in to the air&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, 3D printers are not among the processes covered in the study. In home 3D printing circles, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231013005086&quot;&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt; that looks at ultrafine particle (UFP) emissions, is often cited. It finds that printing ABS releases relatively high levels of UFP's and PLA releases significantly fewer (but still quite a large amount). However, it is unclear whether/how dangerous these UFP's are in the amounts emitted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is often suggested that PLA, partly because of the reduced UFP emissions is safer to print than ABS, partly because of its &quot;natural&quot; origins as it can be derived from materials such as cornstarch. I would caution against this line of reasoning since &quot;natural&quot; materials can still be poisonous (snake venom is natural, after all) and the cornstarch is heavily processed so it hardly resembles its original form. The lower UFP emissions may suggest it is safer, but the study is only quantitative, not qualitative.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, PLA does probably pose less of a risk (despite my earlier argumentation against &quot;natural&quot; materials, PLA does play quite nicely with the human body), but I contend the risk with ABS is not too large anyways, given that it has been safely used in factories for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/fire86/art017.html&quot;&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; is often miscited, supposedly saying that 3D printing ABS releases hydrogen cyanide. The study only looks at the thermal decomposition of ABS, which happens at significantly higher temperatures than are reached during printing (but a significantly malfunctioning printer might cause toxic gasses to be released, but I contend that at that point you should worry about your printer being on fire, rather than temporary exposure to some toxins).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are no printers out there that are fundamentally safer than others. However, some printers have an enclosure (containing the fumes) and some even have a carbon filter and a fan for fume extraction. If you would like to err on the side of caution, this might be a good choice (but again, it is not clear if a carbon filter is totally effective).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, as printers are generally quite noisy it tends to be preferrable to keep your printer in a separate room from where you usually work. In this case, fume exposure (during the few minutes that you go to check on your print) is minimal, and the potential advantages of a &quot;safer&quot; printers or using &quot;safer&quot; materials diminish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Incidental exposure as a hobbyist is probably not a big deal; workers in factories are exposed to the fumes of melted plastic their entire lives and they don't seem to be dropping dead. On the other hand, if you are going to be printing structurally then it is probably preferable to move your printer to a separate room, if not because of health and safety because of the noise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="26" LastEditorUserId="26" LastEditDate="2016-01-12T19:21:43.353" LastActivityDate="2016-01-12T19:21:43.353" CommentCount="2" />

As further travel moves are performed in each layer, this turns to a web.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The high temperature causes filament to be very liquid, causing it to move downward in the nozzle chamber easily, as opposed to having to be extruded forcefully due to viscosity.

Retraction is a process in which the extruder reverses its movement to pull filament back up the hotend, preventing it from dripping at the tip, and forming a string. Most slicers will allow specifying a numeric value in millimeters of filament to be retracted. Remember that printers with Bowden tubes between nozzle/hotend and extruder motor will require increased retraction and priming (extrusion when starting to print after a retract-and-move).

ABS will absorb moisture causing popping when the moisture enters the hot end. This leads to discontinuities in the print job.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;PLA: Doesn't smell as strongly when printing due to its organic nature.

However, the fundamental reason for the &quot;warping&quot; is incorrect and inconsistent temperature across the material.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there is too much fluctuation in the temperature across the object in this heated state can result in warping. The reason you see this mostly on the build plate is because the temperature of the first few layers of molten plastic vary much more against the build plate than against higher layers. Note that you can see additional warping mid-print using ABS and this can be a result of a draft or sudden drop in ambient temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, to help solve your problem, here are some suggestions (sorry if there are duplicates):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Completely enclose/seal your machine's build area to reduce (or eliminate if possible) draft and prevent the natural heat of the machine from escaping.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Increase the temperature on your build plate. I almost exclusively use ABS on my printer and I keep my HBP at about 112C. However, I live in the NW of the US, so my climate is naturally cooler than say Florida.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Alternatively, try decreasing the nozzle temperature to a lower point within the ABS melting range. This will just shorten the gap between the inconsistencies in temperature across layers. It is typically better to print at lower temperatures if you can help it. Obviously there are differences in the filament, so you'll have to find that &quot;sweet spot&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ensure your build plate is flat and your tape doesn't have bubbles. Your BP being flat should be a no brainer, but if your kapton tape (or whatever you use) has bubbles, your freshly printed plastic may not be getting the same temperature from the BP as the rest of your part. This is a bad thing as mentioned earlier.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use extra adhesion techniques such as &quot;ABS Glue&quot; (ABS w/ acetone) or even hairspray.

An acetone &quot;explosion&quot; is even more unlikely, since you need a ratio of 2.5%-12.8% acetone vapor to air for that: too much acetone (as would be the case inside of your smoothing vessel) and nothing happens, too little (as would be the case inside of a badly ventilated room) and nothing happens either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that even if you were working in a completely non-ventilated, ridiculously small 1m^3 room you'd still need to evaporate over half a liter of (liquid) acetone to reach that bare minimum 2.5%. In any case, well before you got into the &quot;danger zone&quot; the air would become unbreathable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, then what should you be mindful of when using acetone?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can give you a headache. Avoid breathing the fumes and ensure adequate ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may opt to use gloves, as skin contact should be avoided (acetone can irritate the skin and possibly be absorbed through the skin). However, limited skin contact isn't a big deal: acetone is an ingredient in some nail polish removers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acetone is heavier than air, so if you use a sufficiently high container fewer fumes will escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If somehow a fire does start, it will likely be limited to your container. Having a lid handy allows you to starve the fire of oxygen, harmlessly putting it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All in all, smoothing using acetone is not very dangerous. Acetone isn't suspected to be carcinogenic, though it isn't something you should be careless around either. The risk of starting a fire is small. On the other hand, solvents like MEK (used for smoothing PLA) aren't as nice by far, and should only be handled with a respirator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="26" LastEditorUserId="26" LastEditDate="2016-01-15T06:31:31.933" LastActivityDate="2016-01-15T06:31:31.933" CommentCount="0" />

There are many ways you can 3D print a part, even on the same machine, that can yield different results.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some tips to help uphold strength requirements:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Identify where your stresses are and avoid allowing the natural &quot;grain&quot; of the print (ie each layer) to coincide with the stresses of the part.

I set my part up to ensure that the circular profile of the hinge on each layer, instead of having the machine &quot;bridge&quot; the circular profile.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Make your part more solid by increasing the infill. Note that somewhere around 35% won't really provide much more strength than say 50% with a standard infill pattern (ie hexagonal, diamond, catfill). However, I would imagine that if a spherical infill pattern was ever designed, that would be the strongest.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An easy way to beef up small areas of a part is to increase your shell variable (how many profile layers for each layer). Again, referencing my hinge design, I made sure that my hinges were completely printed using shell instead of shell/infill.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Don't be afraid to do some post-processing such as adding epoxy(ies) in high-stress areas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it's not an expensive part to print, I would suggest playing with some of these ideas yourself and conduct controlled tests to see what setups work best for your application(s).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastActivityDate="2016-01-13T05:01:54.163" CommentCount="0" />

Depending on the motors you're driving and the size of the load you could actually see a decrease in quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although microstepping increases theoretical resolution it does not necessarily increase accuracy. The reason is that microstepping significantly limits the incremental torque of the motor. This means that you may ask for a step but not get one because the torque of the step won't be enough to actually turn the shaft.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an example: a motor running in full steps will have 100% of its rated holding torque. Moving to 16 microsteps/full steps drops this to ~10%, 128 drops it to ~1%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The practical effect of this is that in high torque situations (such as printing at fast speeds) the motor may end up skipping some of the steps. In this way the increase in resolution can actually lead to a decrease in accuracy (smaller steps but they may not actually be taken).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A relevant calculation to do would be to work out what the different number of microsteps to full steps works out to in terms of horizontal, vertical, or whatever movement the motor drives. You can do this by measuring how far the stepper moves said surface in one revolution provided you know the number of steps it takes per revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With no microstepping: 1 turn/inch * 200 steps/turn = 200 steps/inch or .005 inch/step (127 micron resolution)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With 16x microstepping: 16 * 200 steps/inch or .0003 inch / step (8 micron resolution)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this example 128x microstepping would be absolutely foolish.

This is my situation - where I live dedicated workshops and extra rooms are luxuries that most people do not have.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Realistic Chance of Being Dangerous --&gt; Treat It As Dangerous&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key information at this point in time is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231013005086&quot;&gt;the UFP (Ultra-Fine Particle) study&lt;/a&gt; that is linked in &lt;a href=&quot;http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/a/12/188&quot;&gt;Tom's answer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leaving out the scary / detailed parts:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Therefore, results herein suggest that caution should be used when&#xA;  operating these 3D printing instruments inside unvented or unfiltered&#xA;  indoor environments due to their large emissions of UFPs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;One important limitation to this study is that we have no information&#xA;  about the chemical constituents of the UFPs emitted from either type&#xA;  of 3D printer [...]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[...] there may also be&#xA;  differences in toxicity because of differences in chemical&#xA;  composition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This means that although many processes release UFPs (the authors of the paper compare to cooking), all UFPs are not created equal. Since the UFPs from 3D printing are still an unknown, the only real answer from a safety perspective is to treat them as dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;This is not legal, safety, or professional advice!&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not qualified to give an opinion on what should be done but I will share what I would do:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venting&lt;/strong&gt; - Active airflow pushing the envelope of air around the print into a large, unpopulated body of air.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enclosure + Venting&lt;/strong&gt; - By fully enclosing your printer, it will probably keep the UFPs mostly within the enclosure. You could combine that with either continuous venting or as some have suggested purge venting before opening the enclosure.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enclosure + Filtering&lt;/strong&gt; - A filter can be applied both to the vent to reduce the output of UFPs (e.g. if you have no access to a safe body of air) and as a recirculating system that removes the UFPs from the body of air within the enclosure.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A note on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.silverstonetek.com/techtalk_cont.php?area=en&amp;amp;tid=wh_positive&quot;&gt;positive vs negative pressure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; related to venting and filtering: if you produce positive pressure within the enclosure, you are going to be blowing all the UFPs out into your environment anyway. Negative pressure vented to a safe body of air or neutral pressure with good seals and recirculated filtering may avoid that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A note on filters&lt;/strong&gt;: Activated carbon filters will not remove UFPs. HEPA filters may remove 3D printing UFPs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Which Printer?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As long as the uncertainty exists, I predict that as the market matures, filtering and enclosures will become more standard.

They each have different requirements and restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Notably, IP law varies from country to country.

Attempt to copy a book or copyrighted photo at a paper copy shop and they will typically refuse to reduce their liability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if you show that you have rights to the work, through educational use laws, for instance, they may still refuse because they may be putting themselves in danger of a lawsuit by a particularly aggressive copyright holder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This applies to 3D printing shops in a similar manner.

Binding within the filament feeder and feeder tubes can also be a cause. Bubbles in the filament, or sometimes a mismatch between the filament ideal temperature and the head temperature could create results like this, but it probably wouldn't vary so much between the layers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next I'd look at the print head.

Be especially mindful of the wires from your power supply to the board, as getting those the wrong way around will definitely cause damage. Heated beds and extruders are not polarity sensitive, and can go in either way. Fans are polarized, but will probably survive if you get them backwards - they just won't run. Stepper motors don't care about polarity, flipping the connector around just makes them run backwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take special care with endstops. The endstop connectors have 3 pins (VCC, 5V and signal), endstops with 2 pins are usually connect to GND and signal.

The principle is the same as masking tape, but Kapton tape has a smooth surface and is more durable than masking tape. The down side is Kapton tape is far more expensive, and applying it correctly is a LOT more work, since you have to use water and you have to keep bubbles from getting underneath it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Put some ABS scraps into a bottle of Acetone, and allow the acetone to break down the ABS til you have a slurry. Spread this slurry as evenly as possible across the build plate, and allow the acetone to evaporate away. This leaves a thin film of ABS on the plate, and will release much better than if you print directly onto the build plate. I recommend using clear ABS if you can, since some of it will stick to your print and clear will be the least visible. You'll need to re-apply it regularly, since it will come off with your print where it touches the build plate. &lt;strong&gt;WARNING&lt;/strong&gt;: Use proper ventilation and avoid contact with acetone.

One way of doing this is to print an object with long travel distances, and vary the maximum travel speed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Using the calculator above, increase the &lt;em&gt;acceleration&lt;/em&gt; for various traveling distances until you get suitably smooth acceleration curves for your desired speed for medium to long traveling distances.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Adjust your &lt;em&gt;jerk&lt;/em&gt; setting to allow for quick speedup on short traveling distances. Jerk speed is the speed that the printer will immediately jump to before taking acceleration into account. With a jerk of 20mm/s, the printer will make an immediate jump from 0 to 20 mm/s, and thereafter speed up to the desired speed by following the acceleration profile.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a rule of thumb, it might be smart to then set the actual speed, jerk and acceleration approximately 20% below the the maximum found as a safeguard when printing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, bear in mind that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.no/search?q=stepper%20motor%20strength%20curve%20NEMA%2017&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;biw=1920&amp;amp;bih=985&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;tbo=u&amp;amp;source=univ&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi74aLL46fKAhVIdCwKHdJbDa4QsAQIGg&amp;amp;dpr=1#imgrc=NbUjFTxiWehyKM%3A&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the strength of stepper motors lowers for higher speeds&lt;/a&gt;, so that the nozzle will not hold its path very well if obstructed.

Something sharp, like tweezers, can pick off bits of filament near the tip of the nozzle. I haven't tried other utensils yet, but there are certainly other tools that would work. I've also heard of people regulating temperature with a fan, in order to prevent partially melted bits of filament clogging up the inside of the nozzle, but I don't know if that's effective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the problem could even be as mundane as a support issue. I once set up a spool of filament, only to have a jam when the support for the spool failed, leaving the line of filament tugging at the nozzle and clogging it. Taking steps to prevent this from happening can be simply and effective.

By using this advice you agree to hold me harmless and not sue me as a result of using these instructions/advice. Remember that I am not a professional chemist or a lawyer (this isn't professional or legal advice)!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to research safety precautions and risks on your own to build a personal body of knowledge. The most effective safety precaution available to you is knowledge; the brain is the most important piece of safety equipment! This listing of advice for acetone handling is generated from the highlights of a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for acetone. After reading this advice you should read an MSDS for acetone directly. It would actually be an excellent idea to find and read the MSDS for all the chemicals you use during 3D printing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety Equipment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wear safety clothing! Acetone requires that you wear protective gloves, protective eyewear, and a respirator (to protect your airway). It is also highly recommended to wear protective (ideally also chemically resistant) clothing (like a smock or an apron). These safety clothes are recommended because acetone is a toxic substance which can absorb through the skin and walls of the lungs directly. Make sure to verify the gloves are made of a substance which blocks acetone absorption, also, verify that your respirator is rated to protect against acetone (many respirators are not capable of blocking acetone due to it's volatility).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possess, prepare and understand how to use an eyewash station, a fire blanket, a fire extinguisher (rated for chemical fires), a chemical shower/dousing system and other standard laboratory safety equipment. Posting warning signs along the entrances and exits to the work area about working with a volatile, flammable and explosive gas is also recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep an inert absorption media readily available to cleanup spills should you accidentally fail to avoid a spill. Diatomaceous earth, silica/sand and activated charcoal are all potential absorption media. Should you have a large spill or not possess absorption media (which should not happen - always verify safety equipment is present and working before handling chemicals!) then you may also dilute the spill with water and mop up the dilute solution of acetone. No matter which method you use to cleanup a spill remember to dispose of the contaminated cleanup materials according to the requirements/laws of your local area. &lt;strong&gt;Do not&lt;/strong&gt; lazily dispose of the acetone down the drain without doing research on the correct disposal methods!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control Your Environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure proper ventilation of your workspace (ventilation is required in addition to your respirator due to explosion/fire risk). If the atmospheric concentration of acetone becomes too high the risk for fires and explosions quickly becomes unacceptable (the risk is never going to be zero working with acetone unfortunately, but minimizing it is very important). Working outside is the perfect way to insure the ventilation is adequate, although that presents it's own problems and considerations. Alternatives include using a fume hood, or even something as simple as a fan blowing air through an open window. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliminate any and all sources of flame or spark for a considerable area around all sources of acetone (10-15 meters minimum). Take special precautions to prevent being unknowingly contaminated with acetone (which could then be accidentally transported from the work area to a flame source using you as a carrier). Personal contamination can lead to injury if you attempt to smoke during a break or at anytime before verifying you are not contaminated. It is important to provide an ignition-free environment that extends quite far away from the immediate vicinity of the acetone because acetone can ignite a vapor trail of acetone and allow the flame to travel distances via flashing over the vapor trail. Physical isolation is the ideal solution to this dangerous problem. A policy of always closing the door to the acetone work area is an example of physical separation which would hopefully prevent this vapor trail flash-over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid acetone spills. Acetone is an excellent solvent which could easily eat away the paint on your wall or destroy the finish of your table. Spills also necessitate following special precautions for cleanup and disposal, which have already been provided earlier within this list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acetone Chemistry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not under any condition mix your acetone with chemicals without an extensive analysis and understanding of the products and the risks associated with the reaction. The following list of chemicals will create an explosive compound/mixture when reacted with acetone, so do not allow them to come into contact with acetone: hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, nitric acid, nitric acid + sulfuric acid, chromic anydride, chromyl&#xA;chloride, nitrosyl chloride, hexachloromelamine, nitrosyl perchlorate, nitryl perchlorate, permonosulfuric acid, thiodiglycol +&#xA;hydrogen peroxide, potassium ter-butoxide, sulfur dichloride, 1-methyl-1,3-butadiene, bromoform, carbon, air, chloroform,&#xA;thitriazylperchlorate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should you accidentally ignite some acetone, you must take additional precautions while evacuating or while attempting to extinguish the fire. Acetone is a hydrocarbon and the reaction of burning it produces products which include carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Essentially, humans are incapable of detecting these gases with their senses (detectors exist to measure concentration). However, these symptoms of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide can help alert you to the fact they are present: shortness of breath, blackness along the edges of your vision, confusion, headache, unconsciousness, coma, and finally, death. Carbon monoxide is far more dangerous than carbon dioxide because often the first symptom is unconsciousness, which prevents you from evacuating, leading to death. The dangerous of gas inhalation are substantial enough that as soon as a fire becomes medium-sized you should seriously consider evacuating the area rather than staying to extinguish the fire. It is better to lose property to the fire than to die (if you die I would guess that your property is destroyed anyway!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acetone is a confirmed developmental toxin for females and a suspected developmental toxin for males as well. The risk of breast milk contamination is unknown, but it is a suspected toxic contaminant. Mutagenic and tetragenic effects are not known. The result of this toxicity is that pregnant or breastfeeding women should not handle or be around acetone (due to vapors) even for short periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk of cancer and the carcinogenic properties for acetone are not well-defined, with some declining to classify acetone as a carcinogen and others classifying it as being carcinogenic. California, for instance, has required that acetone bear a proposition 65 warning about cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acetone is definitely a toxic substance, but it is not highly toxic and accidental ingestion or absorption is essentially incapable of causing severe symptoms. Small exposures to acetone (like the exposure levels likely encountered during 3D printing) are more-or-less not very harmful. However, if you do get a problematic exposure to acetone, contact a poison control center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LD50 (&quot;lethal dose 50%&quot;, dose where half of subjects die) in rats is 5800 mg/kg, making the predictable (humans are often similar to rats in regards to toxicity) LD50 for an adult human similarly high. With such a high lethal dose, the predicted toxicity of acetone likely causes chronic sub-lethal damage instead of causing an acute and lethal response. If we assume an average adult human (62 kg) shares the LD50 of a rat- that human would need to consume 392 cc of acetone to reach the LD50. 392 cc is nearly equivalent to 4/10 L- meaning that there is essentially no chance the small consumption of acetone caused by working with it could poison an adult human (if our assumptions are correct).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Potential effects of inhalation, ingestion or skin absorption of acetone:&lt;/em&gt; dry skin, nausea, vomiting, skin irritation, eye irritation, burning sensation, redness, tearing, inflammation, corneal injury, depression, fatigue, excitement, stupor, insomnia, hypersomnia, ataxia, tremors, dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, headache, muscle weakness, loss of motor coordination, speech abnormalities, narcotic effects, coma, kidney damage, liver damage, brain damage, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="251" LastEditorUserId="251" LastEditDate="2016-01-16T22:26:55.593" LastActivityDate="2016-01-16T22:26:55.593" CommentCount="3" />

Here you'll have the option to set the speed in &lt;code&gt;mm/s or %&lt;/code&gt;. If you're having issues with the first layer (or two) not adhering very well to a raft, try reducing the distance between the part and the raft. Mine looks to be a default of 0.2mm. This can be adjusted from &lt;code&gt;Print Settings -&amp;gt; Support Material -&amp;gt; (Options for support material and raft) Contact Z distance&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please note that the closer the part is to the raft, the more likely the part is to sticking to the raft once it cools. So, I would recommend being close by as the part finished so you can quickly remove the raft before it cools with the part. It become especially more difficult with PLA because it becomes hardened during the print process, therefore resulting in a more catastrophic material failure if any part of the object is broken (such as a raft).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'll also note that I primarily use MakerWare for my machine and v3.8 has made it much easier to apply these types of settings.

Generally, the differences are minimal, however:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Generally speaking, a 1.75mm filament will make it easier to use a smaller nozzle diameter (&amp;lt;0.4mm), allowing for more precise prints in some cases.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1.75mm filament will give you better flexibility with flow rates as it has a higher surface to volume ratio, allowing for faster melting in the nozzle, and allowing you to push your printer to higher volume extrusion rates.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The converse of the above points is also usually true. &quot;3mm&quot; filament (which is usually actually 2.85mm) will allow for better control and higher extrusion rates on wider nozzle diameters.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1.75mm filament is indeed more popular than 2.85mm, however the smaller diameter means that manufacturing tolerances really need to be tighter along the length of the filament—a ±0.1mm difference in width along the length of your filament is only ±3.5% for 2.85mm and more like ±6.7% for 1.75mm, so you're going to have a bigger difference in actual flow rates compared to your expected flow rate set in your slicer, resulting in lower-than-expected print quality. That means you're probably going to want to spring for more expensive, higher quality 1.75mm filament in order to get good prints.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Your printer's hardware setup matters, too: Bowden-based printers, like the Ultimaker 2, generally have more luck with the thicker filament because thinner stuff will usually compress more in the bowden tube and create a stronger spring effect, causing extra pressure in the nozzle. This will often cause blobbing, stringing, and over-extrusion and hamper the positive effect of your retractions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, you can tune your printer and slicer settings to create or negate most any of the differences in print quality caused by filament diameter, but you may have an easier time with certain prints and printers with one diameter over the other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastActivityDate="2016-01-16T18:46:49.003" CommentCount="0" />

Some printers have a pause capability, while others do not. Some have multiple extruders, while most do not. Some have a tube leading to the extruder and others do not. You specifically are asking about dealing with more than two colors when you have a dual-extruder, but the question generalizes to how to get more colors than you have extruders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Markers probably offer the easiest solution. You could have different markers on the feeds for each extruder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For printers with no pause ability, you might have to snip one filament and hand feed the second color after the first one until it can be caught by the feeder gear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are rigs that are available, or that you can make, that will let you connect two strands together lengthwise. You can then make up a single piece of filament that has multiple colors. Thus, one extruder head will be generating multiple colors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Kickstarter mentioned elsewhere essentially does this automatically for several strands whose lengths are calculated precisely by special software. The result is a single strand of filament that goes into one of your extruders - the other extruder would be unused with this solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="265" LastEditorUserId="265" LastEditDate="2016-01-18T20:00:31.667" LastActivityDate="2016-01-18T20:00:31.667" CommentCount="2" />

The answer is that gravity does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have any real affect on the stick-to-itivity of the filament. Instead, the plastic bonds to the print bed surface, and then subsequent layers fuse with the previous layer. Nor does gravity have any affect on how the filament is fed or how the belts and gears move. Certain filament roll holders may not be able to be used if they do not clamp the roll down, and the printer also needs to be clamped down.

One of my pet peeves is when people upload STLs that have been adjusted to fit their printer/material.  There are many suppliers of material that vary in quality as well as many materials and different printers that the tolerances shouldn't be built into the part because in the end it usually just makes it harder for others attempting to print the model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you aren't sharing models then all I can say is you are still better off to calibrate your printer and tune your slicer to your material.  You'll have more luck with models from other people and have an easier time designing your own.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you still have trouble then modifying the model is probably the last option.  I don't know of any CAD programs that can work with problems 3D printers have so experience is going to be your only help.

As such, we should treat it and it's process similarly to other pieces of manufacturing equipment (ie mills, saws, etc.). Other (albeit traditional) manufacturing methods such as a mill will typically require post-processing to parts to remove any burrs and clean the parts. Since tools like a mill are a subtractive technology, it can already hold tight positional/dimensional tolerances. However, as 3D printing is additive manufacturing, it's difficult to hold the same tolerances directly out of the machine as compared to traditional tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, I would suggest planning time for a more traditional process after the print if tolerances and connections are a concern. This could be as simple as using a Dremel or using a mill/lathe. I would recommend increasing your shell/floor/roof settings in your slicer to accommodate the subtractive process though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastActivityDate="2016-01-18T15:27:53.853" CommentCount="2" />

They're literally just a pair of wires made from two different special alloys, electrically connected together at the &quot;hot&quot; end. That wire junction can be mounted inside whatever kind of attachment tip or lug is desired.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fact that they're very simple and passive devices makes them extremely precise and consistent between TCs of the same type, MUCH more so than thermistors. Any type-K thermocouple in the world will give you the same accurate output +/-1-2C or so. You can even cut a thermocouple in half, re-twist the ends of the wires together, and it'll still work! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the very small (millivolts) signal they generate is quite susceptible to electrical noise and circuit design. The signal voltage has to be greatly amplified to be useful. So it doesn't take much EMR from your heater or stepper wires to interfere with the TC reading. A frequent problem with TC circuits in 3d printers is the dreaded GROUND LOOP -- if the &quot;hot&quot; tip is electrically connected to the hot block, voltage and current on the heater and motor wires can induce small currents through the TC wires that totally screw up the millivolt signal. The amplifier picks up these stray voltages and it throws off the temp read. So, there are some important guidelines for keeping noise out of the TC wires:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The TC wires must be electrically insulated from the mounting hardware (eye lug, thermowell, whatever your extruder has). You can check this with a multimeter -- you want infinite / out of range resistance from the TC leads to the mounting tip and hot block. While you're at it, make sure your heater cartridge wires aren't shorting to the hot block -- that's unsafe and can also cause problems with TCs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Keep the two TC wires close together, and not immediately parallel to noise sources like PWM-controlled heaters or stepper wiring. If you must run the TC in a bundle with the other wires, TWIST the heater/stepper wiring pairs. (For steppers, twist each coil pair to a different pitch if possible. You don't need to twist the separate coil pairs to each other.) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another common issue with TC circuits is the COLD JUNCTION COMPENSATION. A thermocouple doesn't measure tip temperature, it measures the DIFFERENCE in temperature between the hot tip and the cold junction where the TC is connected to either the amp or copper wiring. The TC amp has an onboard thermistor that it uses to add the temp at the cold junction to the measured signal from the thermocouple. There are a few things you need to do to make sure the cold-junction compensation works properly:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You should run TC wire all the way from the &quot;hot&quot; tip to the TC amp. You CAN splice it and install plugs, but only with more type-K TC wire and proper type-K thermocouple plugs. These use the same metal as the TC wire so they don't generate undesired junction voltages that interfere with the TC signal. If you splice copper wire between the TC and the amp, any temp differences along the copper will not be measured! This is a particularly big problem if you splice to copper inside a warm enclosure and then run copper to an amp outside the enclosure.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The amp should not be super hot. The onboard thermistor is designed to accurately measure temperatures reasonably close to room temp, not hot-block temps. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There should not be large temperature gradients near the amp or between the TC wire termination and the actual amp chip. Place the amp far enough away from the hot end and other heat sources (like stepper motors) that it isn't experiencing weird temp profiles.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you do the above, the TC will output a good signal, and the amp will read it properly. But there's one more hitch. The mainboard has to know how to understand the amp's output. 3D printer control boards that are designed exclusively for TCs, like Mightyboards, usually use digital communication between the amp and the main control chip (MCU). This is high-reliability and does not require any special firmware configuration -- support is baked in. But if you're strapping an external TC amp onto a board that is expecting thermistors, &lt;strong&gt;you will have to tell the firmware how to read the signal from the amp.&lt;/strong&gt; The most common technique is for the amp to output a linear voltage signal to the MCU's normal thermistor input (ADC). Then you configure the firmware to use the appropriate &quot;thermistor table&quot; (really a voltage lookup table) for that particular amp. Depending on your controller board, you also may need to make sure the regular thermistor pull-up/pull-down resistors aren't affecting the amp's output.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So you need to make sure:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You don't have electrical noise issues&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The cold-junction compensation is working as intended&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The firmware and controller board is configured correctly for your amp chip's output&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you do all that, a TC should give superior accuracy and reliability over a thermistor. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-01-20T16:40:01.790" CommentCount="1" />

Backlash will throw off other calibration steps, so make sure there's no slop!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Follow the recommended &lt;strong&gt;extrusion volume calibration&lt;/strong&gt; steps for your slicer. This starts with measuring your filament diameter with calipers and inputting that into your slicer. And then you will usually either &lt;em&gt;&quot;print a single-walled box and measure the thickness&quot;&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;&quot;print a series of 100% infill calibration boxes and adjust the extrusion multiplier to the largest value that looks good without bulging.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; By measuring filament diameter and then adjusting an extrusion calibration setting in the slicer, you will be able to measure future filament and prints will come out right. Giving the slicer fake diameter values will force you to recalibrate every time the diameter changes. Note that you must redo this calibration for each FILAMENT MATERIAL and EXTRUDER DESIGN. Different material/extruder pairs will have different bite depths and effective drive diameter.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precision calibration check&lt;/strong&gt; by printing a variety of object sizes and PLOTTING &quot;desired size&quot; as X and &quot;actual size&quot; as Y. Then find a linear fit equation, y=mx+b. (Do this separately for your printer's X, Y, and Z axes.) &lt;em&gt;The value &quot;m&quot; is your scale error.&lt;/em&gt; You can use your slicer object scaling to fix this. For example, ABS usually requires 100.3-101% scaling to account for shrinkage. If you have scale error with a low-shrinkage material like PLA, you can adjust your firmware's steps/mm value to compensate. &lt;em&gt;The value &quot;b&quot; is your fixed width error.&lt;/em&gt; Assuming you don't have backlash, this is usually caused by the small amount that molten plastic bulges out to the sides, or by extrusion volume calibration error. You can improve this by fine-tuning your extrusion volume. Many slicers also have &quot;horizontal/XY size compensation&quot; settings that you can use to shrink/expand the part by b/2 to correct the fixed width error. Any residual fixed-width error that you cannot correct with slicer settings should be added as a tolerance in your part models. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you follow these steps, you should get +/-0.1mm or better dimensional precision on your prints.*&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*Deltas not included.

But we don't need to get into that right now. There are really two big things to worry about: layer height and extrusion width.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Layer heights of 0.1mm or 0.2mm should be fine. Coarser layers may run into surface finish issues that make the bricks difficult to put together or take apart. There probably isn't much reason to go finer than 0.1mm for this application. Almost all FFF printers can do 0.1mm layer heights as long as it is reasonably well-tuned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any typical household FFF printer with a &quot;normal&quot; nozzle size can print fine enough for the bricks to work. It just needs to be tuned well.&lt;/strong&gt; The smallest &quot;must have&quot; feature in a standard lego brick is the 1.6mm thick wall around the sides. The typical minimum printable feature size for an FFF printer is 2x the extrusion width, because the slicer will place a path on the inside edge of the shape and the outside edge of the shape. (Some slicers will allow single-extrusion features, but this is not generally recommended because it makes weak parts.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, how wide is the extrusion width? It's adjustable, and different slicers auto-recommend different values, but as a safe rule of thumb it needs to be between 1x and 2x your nozzle size. There are some volume calculation quirks in different slicers that may encourage larger or smaller sizes, so sometimes people recommend [extrusion width = nozzle size + layer height] particularly with Slic3r. This is very system-specific. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assuming you have the most common stock nozzle with a 0.4mm orifice, and also set the extrusion width to 0.4mm, the slicer should put four strands in the walls of the LEGO brick. That's good. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where it gets tricky is if you have an extrusion width that does not evenly divide into 1.6mm. Say you are printing with an extrusion width of 0.6mm. There is enough room in the wall of the part to place two full 0.6mm perimeter strands... but then a gap 0.4mm wide will be left in the center. You can't put another 0.6mm strand into that 0.4mm gap. Different slicers handle this different ways. Some will leave an empty space between the walls, and you get a very weak print. Some will mash an excessive amount of plastic into the gap, causing poor print quality as excess material builds up more and more on each layer. Some will push a smaller-than-commanded strand to try to properly fill the volume. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, the general advice with small features is to make sure your extrusion width goes into the part's minimum thickness a reasonable number of times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[Feature size / extrusion width &amp;lt; 2] is BAD  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[Feature size / extrusion width = 2] is GOOD &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[2 &amp;lt; Feature size / extrusion width &amp;lt; 3] is BAD &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[Feature size / extrusion width &gt; 3] is GOOD&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although these will vary somewhat by slicer -- older slicers like Skeinforge tend to have more issues with this than newer slicers. What you should do in practice is check your slicer's print previewer to see whether it is leaving a gap between the strands. Then adjust extrusion width and perimeter/shell count to try to get an intelligent output.

You can't just open a window to air out the molten-ABS smell from the ISS! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;FFF printers put out fumes and nanoparticles. In a space station, the same air gets recycled over and over, and the air purification systems have a specific set of contaminants that they are optimized for, as well as a design capacity for air turnover and chemical removal rates that won't be adjusted just because somebody's printing a space-ratchet today. Protecting cabin air quality is a huge design factor for any experiment that goes into space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Made in Space printing experiments on the ISS to date were performed in one of the vacuum experiment chambers, so any unfiltered fumes (or fire flare-ups) could be vented directly to space if required. In the long run, this isn't going to work -- other experiments may need the vacuum chamber, or &quot;production&quot; printers may be too large to fit. So the printer needs to have its own internal air purification system. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another MAJOR design constraint is launch survival. Rocket payloads must be designed for extreme g-forces without 1) damage, or 2) significant internal shifting of mass which would affect the payload center of gravity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Total payload weight is also quite important here: lifting mass to low Earth orbit is EXPENSIVE. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the microgravity environment itself isn't that big of a deal. Molten plastic is highly viscous and pretty much stays where you put it long enough to solidify, as long as it's sticking to something. But two impacts do come to mind. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;First, an unsecured filament spool will try to unwind itself. Gravity won't provide the contact friction we usually rely on to keep spools from bird's-nesting. (Think about it: a tightly-wound spool is literally a giant coil-spring.) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Second, heat flows are different in microgravity -- you can't rely on passive convection to cool the print or the motors. Accommodations must be made for sufficient forced airflow and heat-sinking on anything that requires cooling. And that includes the enclosure itself, since, as mentioned above, the print chamber must be sealed up tight for air quality control. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, reliability is critical. Amazon doesn't deliver to the ISS (yet). Even a single stripped screw may take the printer out of commission for months until a replacement part can be fit into an upcoming supply launch. Having the printer catch on fire because something shorted would be catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, really, it's all about making a printer robust enough to make it up there, operate safely, and never break.

It will &quot;work&quot; in the sense that your printer will get power, but it won't provide anywhere near as much protection as a lower-rated fuse. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;10A is a lot of current for mains voltage. Depending on what else you have plugged in, there is a fair chance your home's 15A breaker will trip before this fuse does, which kind of defeats the point of having it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even for &quot;fast&quot; fuses, it takes a significant amount of time for them to blow when conducting their rated current. The internal fusible link has to heat up and melt before the fuse stops conducting. The less the overload current exceeds the rating, the longer that takes. A 10A fuse conducting a 10.5A short might take 30 seconds to trip. In the meantime, your printer is melting. Lower-rated fuses will trip faster for the same short and thus provide better protection. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You need to size fuses as small as possible for the required current draw if you want to have any hope of rapidly cutting off an excessive-current event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would recommend a 4A fuse in the USA for this 350w power supply. (Note: the listing title says 360 but the photos show 350.) I use 4A fuses in several printers with 120v / 350w PSUs and they do not trip. But you can do the math for yourself:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;350 watts / 120 volts / 80% efficiency = 3.64A&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The smallest fuse you can find that is larger than this value is what you should use. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, we can argue over whether 80% is the right efficiency value... it could be lower. The PSU label says 6.5A input is required, but that amount of current draw implies either a &amp;lt;50% efficiency (which is quite poor for this kind of PSU) or would only occur for abuse/surge scenarios like starting very large motors. Such short-lived inrush events generally won't trip a fuse unless you do something dumb like lock the rotor. And none of that applies to the small microstepping-driver stepper motor systems we're working with here. This PSU should not draw more than 4A in normal 3D printer use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking at this on the other end -- how much damage will 10A do versus 4A? Lots. If the short is in the 12v system, and the PSU's short protection doesn't trip in (because it's a cheap knock-off) you would roughly multiply the AC fuse current times 10 to get the DC current. And 40A is a downright scary amount of current! Depending on wire gauge, putting 40A through heatbed wiring may make it smell and smoke. Whereas putting 100A through heatbed wiring will almost certainly start a fire. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You're much safer with a 4A or even 6A fuse for this PSU than a 10A fuse. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-01-21T04:38:42.443" CommentCount="12" />

So you can use Makerbot slicing profiles for the Replicator 1. Just keep in mind that Makerbot does not generally test new software revs with their older printers, and DEFINITELY does not test new software revs with competitor knock-offs. Sometimes they appear to break functionality for non-Makerbot machines on purpose. So recent versions of Makerbot Desktop may not &quot;play nice&quot; with your FlashForge. &lt;strong&gt;The most recent &quot;known good&quot; free slicer you should use with this printer is Makerware 2.4.x. You can find links by searching the FF Google Group.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On that note, you may have received instructions to use ReplicatorG with your printer. But RepG is abandonware: development stopped years ago. It should only be used for firmware updates, not as a slicer. You should also only use the most recent version posted on the Sailfish page on Thingiverse: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:32084&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:32084&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using older versions of RepG with newer firmware revs will corrupt your EEPROM! Only use the version downloaded from the link above. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The firmware that comes with the printer is FlashForge's slightly-customized build of either Sailfish or Makerbot's Replicator 1/2/2x firmware. But here's the trick: Makerbot's Rep1/2/2x firmware is just an old, out-of-date, slightly customized version of Sailfish. Makerbot stopped keeping up with bug-fixes and feature additions a long time ago. &lt;strong&gt;Everything is Sailfish:&lt;/strong&gt; just different versions. You should use the most recent official release version listed at:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sailfishfirmware.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.sailfishfirmware.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Follow the instructions in the Sailfish manual from the link above, and RepG will automatically pull the right builds from the official mirror and populate a list of printer options to choose. The trick here is which build to download. As of 1-21-16, there is not an official Monoprice Architect build yet. Which would mean editing a machine xml profile to avoid the firmware throwing warnings. I STRONGLY recommend getting used to the printer using factory firmware before trying to fight with custom machine profiles... But here is the basic process to pick a Sailfish firmware build when you're ready:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First: which Atmega processor version do you have? The large chip in the middle of the control board will either say 1280 or 2560. You need to know which version you have. Bad things happen if you load the wrong version.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second: What is the tooth count on the X and Y drivetrain pulleys? To my knowledge, FF always uses 17-tooth pulleys, which matches the Replicator 1 and FF Creator profiles. The Rep2 and 2x use 18t pulleys, so only use those builds if you have those pulleys. People often mess this up and their prints end up with dimensions ~5% off in X and Y. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third: The Architect has one extruder and no heatbed, so firmware builds that expect those to be connected (Rep 1 Dual, Creator, etc) will throw errors if loaded. You can fix this from the LCD screen or RepG, but that's a whole separate question. Do some printing and learn about the printer before attempting any firmware update so you'll know what to do if you pick a build with the wrong parts. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fourth: This one is just for the sake of completeness. Some FF models were shipped with off-spec heatbeds that require special firmware builds to prevent drawing too much current and overheating / overloading the power supply. The Architect doesn't have that, but firmware builds for those printer models (eg I believe the FF Creator 2560) will under-power regular heatbeds. This is just something you need to know with the Architect if you decide to install a heatbed later. But it's a really critical safety warning for people with those off-spec heatbeds. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this all seems complicated, that's because FlashForge (and in turn Monoprice) relies heavily on the open source Sailfish project to maintain the software ecosystem behind this line of printers. FlashForge has some internal builds that they use for flashing new bots, but these are not kept particularly up-to-date. Nor does FlashForge release the source files, so it's quite opaque where exactly the stock firmware differs from mainstream Sailfish. In the long run, you should install mainline Sailfish. But it's ok to stick with the factory firmware until you get used to the printer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To summarize: Because there is not an existing Sailfish build, you're going to need to do some investigating and some experimenting to figure out which build will work. Don't try that until you're familiar with the printer.

That is, by far, the slowest part of SLA/DLP printing with most modern light sources. Where the speed comes in is that without a peel, a continuous &quot;movie&quot; can be used to cure the resin rather than a series of alternating images and peels. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Top-down printers can print dramatically faster than bottom-up-and-peel printers. CLIP is not necessarily faster than top-down. For example, the Gizmo 3D line of top-down printers are very similar in print speed to CLIP. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gizmo3dprinters.com.au/&quot;&gt;http://www.gizmo3dprinters.com.au/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most &quot;consumer&quot; SLA printers these days use bottom-up-and-peel techniques, because this has some practical advantages over top-down printers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Way less resin is required to fill the printer when the part is pulled out as it builds rather than being lowered into the tank (along with the Z stage) as it builds. Resin is expensive. This also means bottom up printers can be smaller and have fewer mechanical parts such as leveling devices submerged in resin. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Standard resins contain an inhibitor chemical that prevents polymerization in the presence of oxygen, which causes the surface layer exposed to air (and low-level stray light) to not cure. So top-down printers must shoot light through a non-curing layer before reaching curable resin. This makes the tuning more sensitive and can somewhat reduce detail compared to a bottom-up printer curing right on the window.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Replacement vats or windows for bottom-up printers may be seen by manufacturers as a profit-generating consumable, since they have to be replaced somewhat frequently.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Top-down printers have to worry somewhat more about resin flow rates as the part is lowered. Air bubbles may be pulled into the resin or the fresh resin layer above the part may vary significantly in thickness if the part is submerged too fast for the resin viscosity. (Admittedly, bottom-up printers will experience excessive suction forces and potentially break off bits of the print at high peel speeds.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CLIP is a bottom-up technique that doesn't require a peel step, because the vat creates an oxygen layer over the window that keeps the resin from curing directly on the surface and sticking. In that way, it arguably performs more like a top-down printer than a bottom-up printer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Top-down printers that are designed to overcome the above issues and use high-intensity light sources can achieve exceptionally high print speeds.

Can you just print the hole into the part instead of drilling? That's usually best, when possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you need to drill, you'll definitely want to print an undersized hole and then ream it out with the drill. This both provides alignment for the drill and adds extra plastic around the region you'll be weakening. If you don't know where the hole needs to go in advance, fill the model with a hex pattern of tiny holes in the general region of the future drilling. This is an easy way to strengthen the area with more plastic without making the entire part solid. (Using a slicer that allows localized print settings will also work.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hole should be aligned more or less vertical or &quot;across the grain&quot; (+/-45 degrees aligned with the Z axis) to ensure there are nice, strong hoops of plastic around the hole to keep it from splitting. Drilling into a printed part (particularly PLA) from the side / parallel to the XY plane is highly likely to split it. It may even be ok at first but crack later under load or due to creep. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regular wood drill bits work ok, but you need to go slow and take nibbles, leaving the plastic time to cool so it doesn't melt and stick to the bit. (Coolant is an option.) Use a pilot hole, piloted bit, or step drill to remove less plastic per pass. A really sharp bit will perform dramatically better than a dull bit. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Put something hard and drillable like wood behind the plastic part to help avoid breakage and bit-jamming when you break through the opposite side. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-01-24T00:46:42.203" CommentCount="0" />

You'd just plug and play. &lt;strong&gt;That PC power supply will potentially draw more current&lt;/strong&gt; than &lt;strong&gt;the power supply of your 3D printer&lt;/strong&gt;. A standard wire would be able to supply either one of the PC ATX power supplies linked above and would not have a problem delivering a lower current to the power supply of your 3D printer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The switching supply doesn't have a plug like a PC ATX supply, but that on its own doesn't make it any less secure (if wired up properly). It's just less common for household appliances.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I'd like to avoid a fire, or damage to the house wiring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's a good and valid concern. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PC Power supplies deliver 12V and supply more than enough current (like the examples above). They are probably in use in your house already and did neither set it on fire nor damage the house wiring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A switching mode power supply is just as secure and if bought from a known brand unlikely to do you any harm either if used properly and within its specifications.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultimately&lt;/strong&gt;, this is not a question of secure electricity but a trade-off between secure electricity and the price to pay for it.

I know it's expensive and there seems to be a stigma around it, but MakerBot Industries provides quality PLA (some ABS also).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other than that, you've done some of what I would suggest in this case which are the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Speeds&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Layer height&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My only other suggestions would be:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Check how level your build plate is&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Check material requirements. ie ABS is ideal between 230-240C according to MSDS with about 110C build plate temp, PLA between 210-230C. Sometimes too hot of a hotend can result in overextrusion or ooze.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the cylinder is smaller, try changing your slicing settings to have a time minimum for each layer. In my experience, a material like ABS will begin to flare out with variations in the print environment. When the material flares out, as the nozzle comes across the area again, the flared areas will be pushed aside. If you adjust your slicing settings to about 15 seconds (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abcgroup3.com/toolbox/mold_cooling_calc.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;refer to this calculator&lt;/a&gt;), then the material will have time to cool slightly from its plastic state.

I'm not sure if all slicing engines provide this option, but I know MakerWare/MakerBot Desktop and (possibly) Slic3r allow this setting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically, when you're extruding smaller features like this, the previous layer(s) are still very hot and possibly very pliable. So, as your nozzle moves around above the previous layer, the nozzle may (and probably will) push some of this molten plastic around. Chances are you can see it to a certain degree while it's printing. You can definitely see this in a most drastic state if you print a tall and small diameter cylinder. You'll notice that the part will become almost exponentially unstable the higher it goes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By increasing the time your printer takes to print a single layer, you are allowing the previous layer(s) to cool closer to the ambient temperature of the build space, and hopefully not as molten.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please refer to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abcgroup3.com/toolbox/mold_cooling_calc.htm&quot;&gt;this calculator&lt;/a&gt; or a similar one for material cooling times. For a standard shell setting of about 2-3 (0.4mm nozzle) will yield about 130sec to cool down to room temperature. I would recommend (for ABS/PLA at least) about a 15second minimum for each layer, possibly longer depending on the size and spread out of the features.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also note that this can be cheated by simply printing multiple items in the same build plate with the same heights (ie. multiples of the same part). Naturally, it will take longer for the machine to print the rest of the parts and therefore allow each layer to cool slightly before being printed over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Active Cooling&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, some slicing engines have an Active Cooling setting. I don't personally have this option setup on my machine, but I believe it regulates the flow of air directed at your nozzle (usually by use of a mounted fan). This can help cool the layers a bit faster. With ABS, this might result in some pretty bad warping mid-print.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Feedrates&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Try bringing down your feedrates to provide the printed portions of the current layer more time to cool if the above options aren't available. Note that you might also bring down your hotend temp to shorten the time it takes to cool the plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;All else fails&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My only other suggestion is stated above, try printing duplicates on the same plate.

For example, the standard practice of greatly slowing down print speeds on perimeters is largely a result of 8bit processors having inadequate resources for two things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Performing centripetal acceleration calculations for curves&#xA;across multiple gcode segments &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Keeping up with gcode transmission/processing and motion planning for gcode with lots of very small segments, such as in organic models or smooth arcs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When presented with a series of very small segments in a smooth arc or complex curve, the 8bit firmware will likely choke on the required command processing rate and introduce stuttering to the print. These incredibly brief pauses allow residual pressure in the extruder to push out some extra plastic, making a little zit on the print. So most slicers automatically decimate curves and output gcode with reduced resolution to lighten the load on the firmware. Problem solved, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But there's another issue -- the GRBL motion control algorithms underlying all the major open source 3D printer controllers were designed with lots of shortcuts and hacks to allow 8bit processors to execute fast enough. For example, the basic algorithm only looks at the speed or velocity change at the corner between two segments, and uses that to decide when to decelerate/accelerate along the direction of motion. It does not calculate or consider centripetal/radial acceleration whatsoever. This is a really effective hack when printing boxy, low-res models, but it fails miserably on smooth curves with lots of little segments. The firmware does not detect any appreciable velocity change at the corner of any two nearly-linear segments within the faceted curve, and thus does not slow down for the curve. So complex geometry is effectively printed at constant velocity, with no acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Printing complex perimeters unaccelerated means the commanded feedrate must be very low to get good quality. Most printers are limited to about 40mm/s or less on complex perimeters, despite being able to run perhaps 80-120mm/s on low-complexity infill before hitting other speed limits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Between the command processing rate limits and motion planner shortcomings required by low power processors, print speeds must be much lower in practice than is strictly required by the physics and printer hardware. This all comes from 8bit processors. The workarounds and best practices to deal with this problem are so deeply baked into the toolchains and ecosystem that very few people realize there is even a problem. But it's a real limit that can be overcome: a high-speed processor running a more rigorous motion planner could generate higher average print speeds with &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; print quality. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, the ARM-based firmwares are only slowly moving towards more advanced motion planners. This is a big development area right now that is actually driving an upcoming shift away from low-end ARMs like the Cortex M3 towards even faster processors. It's actually not all that hard to max out an 84 MHz Arduino Due by piling on a bunch of firmware features. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The use of 8bit processors also makes printers LOUDER. The biggest consumer of processor time in a typical 8bit printer is the stepper interrupt that fires the step pulses to make the motors move. It is quite typical for &gt;60% of all clock cycles on an Atmega AVR to go to firing step pulses. Because this occurs as an interrupt, other processing tasks that the printer must perform -- like acceleration calculations and heater control -- get squeezed into the brief spaces between stepper interrupt events. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without careful firmware design, the step pulses will completely &quot;crowd out&quot; other functionality like LCD display updates and acceleration calculations. In order to allow higher motion rates without using all the processor resources, 8bit firmwares have a mode called &quot;step doubling&quot; that fires two (or four, or eight) step pulses per stepper interrupt so that half (or a quarter, or an eighth) as many stepper interrupts can be used to produce the same motion speed. This practice de-bottlenecks the processor, but it causes rougher and louder motor motion because the step pulses are fired in bursts rather than a constant frequency. In effect, the microstepping level of the motor is functionally dropped to a coarser mode when the stepper interrupt fires double or quad steps. So the motors get louder, less precise, and in extreme cases may have problems with resonance. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An interesting side effect is that if you switch a Marlin-based printer from 1/16 microstepping to 1/32 microstepping, and keep the same print speeds, the firmware will simply start step-doubling, dropping your effective microstepping level right back down to 1/16.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ARM-based firmwares also use step doubling, but the allowable step rates are typically ~8 times higher before double/quad stepping is used. That can mean higher speeds and/or smoother motion. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another issue with 8bit AVRs is the lack of hardware floating point and need to spend many clock cycles on high-precision calculations or handling very large numbers. Delta kinematics, auto-leveling functions, calculating moves with extremely high step counts for large printers, and other advanced functionality all take a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of clock cycles on an 8bit processor. Poor firmware design or carelessly adding a feature that requires a few extra square roots and trig functions can completely bog down the processor. This kind of feature creep and code bloat has seriously impacted Marlin's performance over time as people ask more and more of the old AVR. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, a 32bit processor doesn't just have a faster clock and more clock cycles, it is also able to do much more complex math in fewer clock cycles, because it has dedicated hardware functionality that takes care of many of the steps an 8bit processor must do in software. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do 8bit processors work? Sure, they work surprisingly well for what they are and what we ask of them. But they unquestionably limit the performance and features of modern 3D printers. Even today's current generation of 32bit processors is already being maxed out by high speed printers and math-heavy features. The 8bit processor is already two generations behind what would qualify as a &quot;modern&quot; 3D printer controller. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-02-10T23:18:08.370" CommentCount="5" />

Printing at a lower layer height can dramatically increase the smoothness of the finished part, while equally increasing the printing time - among several other things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A minimum layer height of 0.1 mm is fairly common for low-cost desktop FDM printers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Nozzle diameter:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just like the layer height defines the vertical resolution of a print, the nozzle diameter defines the sharpness of horizontal features of a print. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When printing with a large nozzle diameter, all sharp edges and corners of the model will have a slight roundness to them: the larger the nozzle diameter, the more rounded sharp corners will be, and vice versa.

Most RepRap style 3d printers use thermistors. So you would need to replace the extruder temp sensors, or choose a new controller with thermocouple support. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Makerbots use 24v heaters and fans and PSUs. Most RepRap style 3d printers run on 12v (although this is slowly changing because 24v is better for performance and safety.) You can either pick a new controller that is known to be compatible with 24v, or replace all 24v-rated components with equivalent 12v-rated components. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The existing heatbed thermistor circuit is probably not the same kind of circuit that your new controller will expect. Older Makerbots use a small voltage divider circuit on the HBP PCB to convert the thermistor resistance to a voltage signal, whereas RepRap style controllers typically have this circuit on the mainboard and thus need only a simple thermistor hookup. You could add a new thermistor, or modify the existing circuit, or get an entirely new heatbed. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The existing endstops are full +5v,GND,Signal style mechanical switches with debounce capacitors and LED indicators. These &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be compatible with &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; controller boards given proper firmware setting, but you may need to do some creative wiring if there isn't a suitable three-pin endstop port on your chosen board.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The LCD and 5-button panel will not work with other boards. You'll need to replace that or just run a remote host via USB.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Connectors may be different, of course. That's always an issue with any board swap. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You will need to export RepRap style gcode instead of .x3g files. Makerware/Desktop can export gcode but there may be some minor differences in Mcode assignments from what most RepRap style firmware will expect. I couldn't tell you offhand whether this will work, but to be safe, it would probably be best to use a more traditional RepRap slicer (Slic3r, Cura) or Simplify3D.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So that's a healthy to-do list. At a certain point you're practically building a new printer. &lt;strong&gt;But there is a significantly easier approach&lt;/strong&gt; than installing a RepRap style controller: replace the dead Makerbot Mightyboard with a compatible community-designed Sailfish board like the Azteeg x3 by Panucatt or new CloneBoard Mini by Carl Raffle. Or, if you're ok with Chinese sourcing, a FlashForge Mightyboard will be a near 100% drop-fit replacement for your Makerbot Mightyboard. Any of these options will give you fresh new electronics with minimal hardware changes in the rest of the printer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Either way is fine and you'll end up with a working printer. Using another Sailfish board will certainly be easier, if you don't object to staying within the Sailfish/x3g toolchain and Makerbot/Clone parts ecosystem. Makerbot does have a very bad community reputation these days, but it's important to remember that the Replicator 1 Dual is a completely open-source machine from the &quot;pre-evil&quot; days, and compatible spare parts are widely available from literally dozens of vendors.

I have heard from a number of resellers that the problems are fixed. Unfortunately, both of those are somewhat biased sources. It's surprisingly hard to get good info on the subject -- very few credible people are talking about recent experiences with the product line. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #1:&lt;/strong&gt; The main surviving user forum (&lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/makerbot-users&quot;&gt;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/makerbot-users&lt;/a&gt;) has had the torrent of people reporting 5th gen issues more or less dry up. There ARE still people posting issues, but at a fairly low level that is not far outside what you would expect for an average hobbyist printer. What we DON'T know is whether the flood of complaints has slowed because they're working better, or because very few people are actually buying them any more. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #2:&lt;/strong&gt; The power-users and community leaders that typically evaluate and review 3d printers are all avoiding the 5th gen line like the plague. Makerbot burned up a lot of community good-will by going closed source with the Replicator 2, and lost more good-will through a series of misunderstandings over patent applications and the Thingiverse terms of service (Takerbot scandals), and put the nail in the coffin by &lt;strong&gt;knowingly&lt;/strong&gt; releasing a non-functional 5th gen product line. Very few credible people are willing to give them a chance at this point, so there is a severe shortage of unbiased reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #3:&lt;/strong&gt; Makerbot has a proven history of buying off journalists and reviewers to get positive 5th gen press. Some verifiable examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hundreds of fake 5-star Amazon reviews from paid review accounts. A relevant analysis: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JI8LRRXZYNX1/&quot;&gt;http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JI8LRRXZYNX1/&lt;/a&gt; (Not verified, but related: a widely-believed rumor states that the German Amazon site actually wiped all of Makerbot's 5th Gen reviews because of blatant tampering: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/MakerBot-MP05825-Replicator-5th-H%C3%B6he/dp/B0183TP806/&quot;&gt;http://www.amazon.de/MakerBot-MP05825-Replicator-5th-H%C3%B6he/dp/B0183TP806/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The CES awards initially given to the 5th Gen line were given before Makerbot had functional firmware. None of the 5th Gens at the CES launch were functional. All demo prints shown were made on Replicator 2s. How could a non-functional product win awards? Not hard to figure that one out. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Historical positive press in the 3DP journalism media (3ders, Make Magazine, etc) has been directly proportional to the volume of ad-buys from Makerbot or the parent company Stratasys. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could keep going, but you get the idea. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So it's hard to evaluate the reality of the situation. &lt;strong&gt;But even IF the Smart Extruder issues are truly all fixed&lt;/strong&gt; (jams, leveling issues, thermocouple connection, filament encoder failures, etc), &lt;strong&gt;there are still meaningful problems with the product line.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The print quality is not impressive. The motion mechanics, which have not been appreciably changed to my knowledge, are not great. The Smart Extruder is basically a giant pendulum wobbling off the side of a non-optimal gantry selection of an H-bot architecture. Makerbot has addressed the floppy construction via firmware tweaks to significantly slow down the machine to give marginally-acceptable print quality. According to most reports I have seen, a Replicator 5th Gen will print significantly slower than a Replicator 2, for example. Expect in the neighborhood of perhaps 30-40% longer print times than comparable printers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The price tag is roughly double or even triple the current market price for the size and print quality output of the machine. There are so many great printers on the market now for significantly less money that it's kind of nuts to drop the cash on a Makerbot.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is marketed as a PLA-only machine. That's fine if you're printing art and trinkets, but it's not a great option for mechanical parts. While you CAN print other materials, this is not technically supported. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The support plan structure has quite frankly become abusive. Makerbot used to have really helpful phone tech support, but the crushingly massive volume of 5th gen troubleshooting requests forced them into a paid tech support model. Around the same time, Makerbot shut down their user community forum and deleted links to external technical resources off their website. So unless you know the right places to go, support is scarce. For official tech support you must buy &quot;Makercare&quot; or pay for each help ticket. This is completely out of line with industry norms for a hobbyist/consumer 3d printer. They essentially took their biggest liability -- unreliable printers -- and tried to twist it into a profit center. I personally think this is a significant reason to avoid the company entirely.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to get good results from a Replicator 5th Gen? Sure. But it's a poor value for the cost, from a company that has spent the last few years systematically driving away its former loyal user base.

This plunger used copper washers to help adjust the tension required. Many people ended up upgrading their assemblies to the spring loaded mechanism as the plunger would either put too much or too little tension against the drive gear. Too little and the filament will not be driven into the hotend. Too much and the filament will grind against the drive gear and the drive gear may begin to &quot;eat&quot; away at the filament (especially when the filament becomes hotter). Obviously, if the drive gear is no longer able to catch on the filament, the nozzle will get clogged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, even with a spring mechanism, your tension can become too high. Most of these mechanisms allow you to adjust the tension by tightening/loosening the screw holding down the spring. The &quot;sweet spot&quot; for me is just past when the filament can be successfully driven into the hotend. You can test this if you have control over your extrusion motor by removing the extrusion motor from its mount, leaving the spring mechanism installed on the face of the motor. Then, turn your motor on and try feeding the filament through the mechanism. Starting with no tension on the spring, begin slowly increasing tension by tightening the screw on your mechanism until the drive gear is successfully able to guide the filament through. I might even complete another half turn on the screw to account for varying diameters and plasticity states of the filament as it becomes hot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this helps and please keep us updated on anything else you find.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastActivityDate="2016-02-21T00:46:09.740" CommentCount="1" />

Additional firmware parameters clutter up my (beginner's) brain even more (and I haven't had a too deep dive into that yet).&#xA;In general I understand that the frequency we use to send the steps to the stepper is the main determining factor, also 'reduced' by microstepping, if applied. We cannot keep the current up as much as needed due to timing/inductive/electronic properties of the motors, so we lose torque or finally steps. A higher voltage helps to bring the current up faster, so the steepness of the current increase can also limit the maximum applicable frequency. The frequency itself is given from the controller board to the motor driver, hence is set in firmware.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All in all, apart from what makes sense to utilize in a 3D printer setup, what are the determining factors of the stepper speeds that can be realized and how to they transform into real life values for our printers?

There is a significant range, particularly when 32bit firmwares and RTOS-based platforms like MachineKit are compared to 8bit firmwares running on Atmega AVRs. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Marlin on a 16 MHz 8bit Atmega can only run the stepper interrupt at 10,000 hz without bogging down the processor and blocking other critical algorithms (like motion planning). It can fire step rates up to 40,000 hz by pulsing the step line two or four times per interrupt, which effectively drops the microstep level in software and runs the motors rougher/louder. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Repetier on the same Atmega can run the stepper interrupt at 12,000 hz, because it is optimized more for execution speed than Marlin.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Repetier on an 84 MHz 32bit ARM Cortex-M3 can run the stepper interrupt at 80,000 Hz.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These limits typically only affect actual stepper speed when relatively fine microstepping is used.&lt;/em&gt; Consider an example based on a very typical Marlin printer configuration. Microstepping of at least 1/4 is strongly recommended to avoid resonance issues, so let's start with 1/16 stepping. This allows quad-stepping to effectively output 1/4-steps. Starting with finer microstepping will drop our top speed, and coarser microstepping will be louder and may encounter resonance, so this is a good starting point. Then asssume a typical 32mm-per-rev pulley on a 1.8 degree (200 steps/rev) stepper motor. This system has a resolution of 200*16/32= 100 steps/mm. At 40,000 Hz total stepping rate (quad-stepping at 10,000 Hz) we can theoretically travel at 400 mm/s before hitting Marlin's hard cap. That's probably going to be a higher RPM than we want to run the motor anyway, so it's not a very impactful limit. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, if we started at 1/128 stepping (such as with the THB6128 driver chip) our top speed with 8bit Marlin would be 50 mm/s. That's quite slow. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firmware motion planners&lt;/strong&gt; can further limits motor speed by ramping up and down to traverse turns and corners. If the model geometry has lots of sharp turns, the target speeds commanded by the gcode are likely to never actually be reached. Only long, straight line paths will have enough ramping time to hit the speed target. You can see this yourself by printing a very small model at a variety of feedrates and timing the actual print duration: at a certain point, increases in the commanded speed will make no difference on actual print times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another constraint some firmwares enforce is requiring the ability to safely decelerate to a stop within the length of all the motion commands in the planner queue. This allows the printer to gracefully handle a sudden loss of input, such as as if the host computer stops transmitting USB commands, or if the SD card experiences a series of read errors. If the printer just abruptly stops from full speed when it runs out of commands, it is likely to lose position and ruin the print. Whereas if it can decelerate to a safe stopping speed, it may be able to resume after the command stream resumes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of actual motor behavior, the &lt;strong&gt;inductance and back-EMF&lt;/strong&gt; introduce significant limits because they decrease motor torque at higher RPMs. This produces a torque/RPM curve that drops off at higher speeds:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/BHxwY.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/BHxwY.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html&quot;&gt;http://www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note in the picture that there is a flat &quot;constant current&quot; region on the left side at low speeds. This is the range where the chopping driver is limiting coil current. On the right side of the curve, current is not able to reach the target before it must be switched back off for the next step. That reduces field strength and thus torque.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two separate effects to consider here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Motor coils are inductors, which means there is a first-order lag between applied voltage and coil current. A standard bipolar stepper motor with a microstepping driver must raise the coil current from zero to max or from max to zero every full step (eg every sixteen 1/16th microsteps). At high step rates, there is not enough time to fully charge the coil to its max current before the next step requires dropping the current back down. Without developing full coil current on each step, torque is lost. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Every motor is also a generator, and spinning the rotor generates back-EMF voltage within the motor coils. That voltage waveform gets overlaid on top of the drive voltage waveform with a phase shift dependent on the rotor position relative to the coil energization position. &lt;em&gt;In simple terms, this voltage attempts to brake the motor:&lt;/em&gt; it always does whatever will slow the motor down. This means it opposes the applied drive voltage when the motor is applying forward torque, or assists the applied drive voltage when the motor is applying brake torque. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a practical discussion of speed limits, we can simplify the situation by assuming back-EMF voltage opposes the drive voltage applied to the coils. This means there is less effective voltage raising/lowering coil current, and it takes longer for the current to change, and less coil current is developed than would be the case without back-emf. This further depresses the torque/RPM curve of the motor. And when the back-EMF voltage is around the same magnitude as the drive voltage, significant motor instability can result because of complex feedback effects between rotor position and effective coil voltage. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can play with these effects using different motor configurations and speeds for a few popular 3D printer stepper drivers using my stepper driver simulator: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rcarlyle/StepperSim&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rcarlyle/StepperSim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In closed-loop applications with position feedback and high-end drivers that can damp various instability modes, it may be ok to run the stepper all the way down the torque curve at very high RPMs. In more typical open-loop 3D printer applications, it's generally best to stick to the low-RPM part of the torque curve before inductance and back-EMF really take over the motor behavior. Losing too much torque can easily mean skipping steps and losing position, ruining the print. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another important effect for steppers is &lt;strong&gt;mid-band resonance&lt;/strong&gt;. This is not a normal mechanical resonance, but actually an electromechanical resonance effect. It's quite complicated, but the short explanation is that a stepper has an intrinsic 90-degree phase shift between position and torque, and when speeds rise to a point where coil inductance introduces an additional 90-degree phase shift between coil current and applied voltage, the electromechanical system has a highly-unstable 180-degree phase lag and thus creates a negative feedback loop. This can rapidly drop motor torque until the motor loses synchronicity with the driver's applied voltage and stalls.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mid-band resonance only occurs when coil current is limited by inductance. It cannot occur in the constant-current drive range because there is not enough phase lag between applied voltage and coil current.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZO8nN.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZO8nN.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html&quot;&gt;http://www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, measured torque curves available from manufacturers almost never show resonance zones, because the curves are produced by loading motors with friction-brakes that damp any kind of resonance effect from building. Whereas a 3D printer drivetrain load is almost entirely inertial (accelerating a mass) which is much more prone to resonance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;High-end drivers can automatically detect and damp mid-band resonance, but typical low-cost 3D printer drivers do not have this capability. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is generally prudent to avoid entering an RPM range where mid-band resonance may occur. This is easily accomplished by sticking to the left side of the torque curve, in the constant-current operating region. This ensures high torque and good stability. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a concrete example, consider the popular Kysan 1124090 stepper with a 24v power supply. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/SUFIv.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/SUFIv.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ultimachine.com/content/kysan-1124090-nema-17-stepper-motor&quot;&gt;https://ultimachine.com/content/kysan-1124090-nema-17-stepper-motor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To maintain high torque and avoid mid-band resonance, we would want to keep the RPM to about 400 or less. For the same 32mm-per-rev pulley mentioned above, that would limit speeds to around 200-240 mm/s. Higher speeds are possible, but may encounter reliability issues. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This speed, of course, assumes a 24v PSU is used, to match the measured torque curve: a 12v PSU would have a significantly lower top speed before inductance starts to limit coil current, around half as fast. Higher supply voltage &lt;em&gt;greatly&lt;/em&gt; increases the top effective speed for the motor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, you can easily simulate this effect if you know the back-EMF voltage per RPM for your motor. (Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rcarlyle/StepperSim&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rcarlyle/StepperSim&lt;/a&gt;) The back-EMF parameter is critical at higher speeds, but unfortunately, it is not typically provided in manufacturer datasheets. But it is very easy to measure by spinning the motor at a known RPM (such as with a drill press) and measuring the open-circuit RMS AC voltage across one of the coils. This simulator output chart shows how inductance and back-EMF are keeping coil current from reaching the target:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/GYMc7.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/GYMc7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For practical drivetrain design, a motor/driver simulator is really the best tool in the toolbox for finding the point where performance will start to degrade due to inability to hit current targets. It's simply too complex to apply simple equations or rules of thumb with any accuracy. These electrical effects and the firmware step generation limits are likely to be the two main restrictions on motor speed for most printers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, how fast you can melt plastic will tend to limit printing speeds significantly below the true motor speed limits, but that's a different discussion. For the moment, we can simply say that top motor speed tends to be unimportant for print moves in typical Cartesian printers. However, there are a few instances where they are likely to drive printer performance:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Linear Deltas, where carriages may need to run several times faster than the effector for certain move directions&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Geared extruders with high reduction ratio (eg much over 5:1) for high retraction speeds&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Short-pitch lead screws (or all-thread) that need high rotation speeds to achieve moderate linear speeds&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastEditorUserId="298" LastEditDate="2016-02-22T18:02:29.563" LastActivityDate="2016-02-22T18:02:29.563" CommentCount="0" />

I'm not familiar with the inner workings of how it works, but the general advice is to be conscious of what you're working with. A heat-induced vapor treatment seems to yield the best surface finish, but can be tricky to track down proper exposure times. It seems that the time required to achieve a desirable surface finish depends on the size and openness of the features on the object. By openness, I mean how evenly the vapor is able attach itself to the surface of the object as compared to other features. Some this variability may be reduced by streamlining the process. Perhaps if you found a way to rotate either the part or the vapor container during the process. This could ensure contact is made in small corners/features. Other variables to consider may be:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If a gradual reduction of exposure is necessary (as is with most heat treatment operations)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How much temperature effects time. Most pages I've read mention 100C as the temp to vaporize the chemical.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Size of the &quot;vaporization chamber&quot; in accordance with how much of the chemical is available. I've used a gallon paint can lined with lightly dabbed paper towel with Acetone for part between 1&quot;^3 to about 4&quot;^3&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's all I can think of, currently, that could potentially have the most impact on the process. Just as with 3D printing, there's not an easy way to definitively know how your parts will turn out. The sheer difference in the shape of your parts could throw out any &quot;proven process&quot; you come up with.

(How THAT is done is a different question.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The net effect is that the printer will move through a series of small &quot;linear&quot; carriage movements (linear meaning constant* speed with respect to time) that collectively approximate the necessary curved (quadratic position with respect to time) carriage motions required to produce a straight-line end-effector move.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*(&lt;em&gt;Constant speed before acceleration slowdowns are applied in order to obey dynamics constraints, anyway. Again, that's the subject of a different question.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Segmentation is very similar to the process of using a polygon to approximate a circle. If the facets are small enough, the polygon is a good approximation. Higher Segmentation rates produce less path-following error.  The primary conceptual difference between drawing circle arcs and Delta motion paths is that the so-called &quot;faceted arc&quot; with Delta Segmentation is constructed in height-vs-time coordinates instead of the X-vs-Y coordinates you'd use to draw a circle on a computer screen. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This system is used in large part because support for Delta style printers was originally bolted onto GRBL-based motion planners which were written exclusively for straight-line motion paths in Cartesian printers. It was a relatively minimal modification to the existing codebase compared to implementing full quadratic path interpolation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Techniques have evolved over the years. And alternate approaches are often used: for example, the dc42 fork of RepRapFirmware performs exact path-following without segmentation, by recalculating the proper time for the next step &lt;em&gt;after every step&lt;/em&gt;. This is functionally equivalent to approximating a circle with a polygon facet count &lt;em&gt;so high that every pixel on the screen gets its own facet&lt;/em&gt;. So it is exactly as accurate as the positioning resolution of the motors allows. The downside is that this segmentation-free technique is fairly processor-intensive, so it only works on relatively fast controllers, not the older 8bit Atmega AVR that powers most existing consumer/hobbyist printers today. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other techniques are possible. The academic parallel robotics control literature is a whole other world of mathematical techniques and complexity in order to produce generalized control algorithms that work for a wide range of robot mechanisms.

But all the bolts holding it together are only 4 times as strong. So weight-bearing bolts are effectively under twice the strain (per unit of cross-sectional area); the exact factor depends of lots of things (orientation, leverage, etc).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you scale up by 10x, they'll potentially be under 10 times greater stress, and probably snap.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many, many parts will have similar issues: Drive belts that are twice as wide and twice as thick will still have 1/2 the (relative) strength -- and stiffness for the motors to overcome. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The stepper motors have to move 8 times the weight, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you'll want them to move far, far faster. But steppers lose torque when you spin them faster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My main printer is pretty much a MendelMax 2, but the Y axis is about 6 times bigger (X and Z are normal). On MM2 the whole build platform moves along Y -- on my printer it weighs far more than on a regular-size MM2 -- it's 6 times the mass just because of size, besides that it has to be much stiffer to avoid sagging over that distance. I went to a larger motor, but it could still barely move the axis. I eventually got it to move at pretty normal speed, but to print long objects it really should be 6 times faster or so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That would require an amazing motor -- and really big electronics to drive it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another challenge is the printing material -- 20mm diameter PLA fiber would be really impressive, but a little hard to find, and a spool would be hard to lift.

If you want to do high-speed printing or use any of the fancier features, you should go with 32bit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The big issue with 8bit comes up when you want to do something that taxes the MCU. Delta kinematics already add a lot of extra math on top of all the normal printer functions like command parsing, motion planning, and heater control. For example, adding any of these to an 8bit Delta can cause issues:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bed tilt compensation &quot;auto-leveling&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; -- the coordinate space rotation transform adds a lot of extra floating point calculations to every movement segment. That really taxes the 8bit Atmega since it does not have native floating point support. (Note that pre-print auto-calibration such as in the RichCattell Marlin fork is not the same as bed tilt compensation and does not add any run-time processor load.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full graphics LCDs&lt;/strong&gt; -- refreshing the LCD screen for animations and status reports takes a surprising amount of horsepower. 8bit Marlin is widely known to suffer from stuttering and print quality issues when running a GLCD on a delta.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highly faceted (smooth) curves, particularly over USB&lt;/strong&gt; -- the high rate of gcode command processing sucks up a lot of clock cycles, particularly in firmwares that run USB comms as a top-priority interrupt. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What the Due (or other 32bit board option) does for you is de-bottleneck the MCU so you can push the printer harder or utilize features that add processor load. Here's why they're so much better:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In simple clock speed terms, the SAM3X8E in the Due/Duet/Alligator/etc is about 5 times faster than the Atmega 2560, and the LPC1769 in the Smoothieboard/MKS-SBASE/etc is about 7 times faster. But they're actually MUCH higher performance than clock speed alone would suggest, because the 32bit architecture and native floating point support mean far fewer clock cycles are required for complex calculations. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They also have more RAM, meaning the the firmware can manage more features and look farther ahead when motion planning. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They also have more program space, meaning the firmware can, if desired, be compiled as a single full-featured build that covers all possible printers (as RepRapFirmware and Smoothieware do) and thus end-users don't have to edit and compile code in the Arduino IDE to configure the firmware. The Atmega line requires hundreds of conditional compile statements in the firmware to exclude unused features from the binary to get the memory footprint down.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All that said, the switch from an 8bit Atmega AVR to a 32bit ARM Cortex-M3 is still just an upgrade from a late-1990s processor to an early-2000s processor. Neither is &quot;modern&quot; by any stretch. &lt;em&gt;(For example, the BeagleBone Black used by Redeem and MachineKit utterly blows away the Due in processing power and memory. But those options have steep learning curves at the moment.)&lt;/em&gt; The Due can still be bogged down by printing very fast with lots of features enabled. It's a &lt;strong&gt;big&lt;/strong&gt; upgrade on an Atmega, but I predict it's going to be replaced by much faster controllers within the next few years. Announcements of upcoming next-gen controller boards are already trickling out. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To summarize, the answer is yes, a Due-type board is a good buy if you want a high-performance printer. It will meet 99%+ of user's needs today.&lt;/strong&gt; But it will be replaced in a few years, just like the Atmegas are being replaced now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As for specific Due shields, I strongly recommend NOT going with RAMPS-FD.&lt;/strong&gt; It was cloned for sale by Asian companies before the design was finished, which seemingly caused the original designer to abandon it before working out all the bugs. RAMPS-FDv1 has some nasty design flaws such as heaters turning on while flashing firmware. RAMPS-FDv2 is better, but can experience unreliable and oddball behavior due to unresolved issues in the circuits intended to make it compatible with both 3v3 boards like the Due and 5v boards like the Mega. (For example, the thermistor voltage reference circuit needs modifying to work right, and there appears to be timing issues in the 3v3-5v level shifters.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RADDS is a good Due shield.&lt;/strong&gt; It is a simpler, more reliable, more compact version of RAMPS-FD. It is very popular in Germany and has recently (late 2015) become available for sale in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also recommend purchasing the Due R3-E instead of the regular Due R3. Anecdotally, the &quot;E&quot; version appears to eliminate some firmware bootup issues that can occur when the board is first powered at lower than nominal voltage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One possible downside to the Due is that Arduino just announced they are no longer manufacturing it. So all new Due boards from here on will be made by 3rd parties. That's not necessarily bad, since it's open source and many other companies will surely continue making them, but there won't be any more made by Arduino. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For single-board options using the same SAM3X8E processor as the Due, the Duet 0.8.5 is becoming quite popular. (It runs RepRapFirmware, which has some great Delta features.) The Alligator runs Repetier. There are several other beta/experimental/development boards in the works too.

Direct drive extruders are highly recommend. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;TPUs (thermoplastic urethanes) in particular can be sticky in the filament feed path between the spool and extruder. Try to minimize corners and turns (even inside PTFE tubes) between the extruder and spool. As a general rule of thumb, don't exceed 180 degrees of cumulative tube curvature in the entire path from the spool to the nozzle. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once your filament feed path is fully enclosed, the filament will be constrained and unable to squeeze out the side or wrap around your drive gear. That's the most important step.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next problem is simply &lt;strong&gt;loading&lt;/strong&gt; the filament. Purging out PLA or ABS with a soft TPE can be challenging because of the force required to purge the old material. Many default loading routines are actually too fast for TPEs and will cause the TPE filament to bunch up rather than purging the previous material. It tends to extrude better when there is nothing else in the way. Some tips:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do some cold-pulls to clear out the hot end as much as possible before loading the TPE. (Nylon is ideal for this. Preheat to nylon temps, run through some nylon, let the extruder cool to ~180C, and then forcefully pull out the nylon. If you can't pull it out, pull hotter. If it leaves nylon behind, pull colder.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you have a high-melting plastic like PET or nylon in the hot end, purge with a lower-melting solid filament like PLA first. This will reduce the viscosity of the old material when inserting the TPE. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If your printer has a fixed loading speed, consider making a gcode file with nothing but a preheat and very slow extruder move as a custom loading script. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you fail to load and jam up the TPE, try again! Sometimes it takes a few load/unload cycles to get the old material purged and a clean feed going. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The final issue is &lt;strong&gt;print settings&lt;/strong&gt;. You ever hear the saying, &quot;you can't push a rope&quot;? That's kind of what you're fighting with TPEs. With a properly constrained feed path, you can push rubber, but not very hard. So minimizing extrusion force is the name of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Print SLOW to start. Like 10mm/s. You can dial it up once you're getting good results. This will minimize nozzle back-pressure and reduce the amount of &quot;pushing a rope&quot; that the extruder drive must do.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Retract as little as possible. Turn off &quot;optional&quot; retractions in your slicer, such as during layer changes. Some people even print with no retraction at all, and use high travel speeds and coast/wipe features to minimize stringing. That's overkill, but it can help with marginal extruders. I personally add about 50% to my normal ABS/PLA retraction distance. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Print on the hotter side of the recommended range to start, then dial down the temp as needed to reduce stringing and oozing. Printing hot will reduce nozzle back-pressure.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With all that, it should be possible to print the softest TPEs with reasonable success. But if you really can't get it working right, plenty of higher-durometer TPEs are available now that are significantly easier to extrude. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-02-29T04:09:53.643" CommentCount="1" />

Preheat, load, unload, level bed, etc are all done via the LCD and seamlessly built-in scripts. There is no need to connect host software to do anything but update firmware and change rarely-adjusted settings like acceleration parameters. RepRap-style USB control of Sailfish printers is perfectly functional, but not really necessary 99.9% of the time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a major reason why Sailfish printers have historically been popular for printer farms. They're designed for stand-alone operation, which is highly favorable when the printers greatly outnumber the associated computers. It's extremely rare to see a Sailfish printer from the last 5 years without a 5-button LCD panel. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Sailfish firmware UI/UX is simply built around the LCD buttons rather than host software. This is &lt;em&gt;generally&lt;/em&gt; more reliable and higher-performance than, say, Marlin via host because it reduces processor time spent on command transmission and eliminates all the possible failure modes in the PC and USB link. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assuming all Sailfish printers will have LCDs with SD card support and focusing on that one interface really allowed the creation of an overall better printer. More optimization, fewer things that need to be configured by the end-user. But in exchange, you're limited in what kind of hardware Sailfish will support. It's a tradeoff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, LCD support was more strapped onto RepRaps as an option rather than the core interface element. This tends to produce a host-driven interface design, rather than an LCD-driven interface design.

PLA that is too hot will smell of pancakes/waffles much stronger than normal, or even smell burnt. The printed material may be more shiny than usual.

The external TC should read within a few degrees of the printer's TC.

To make it clog, there must be something that block the path which make the step driver couldn't push the filament through right? even using your hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This problem is call &quot;heat creep&quot;, especially if you print small detail things. This is because small details make the filament stay inside the nozzle longer, which the heat eventually make the filament swole up and block the path. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To find out if your problem is cause by &quot;heat creep&quot; or not, try to print something small but tall and print something large overall. If it is heat creep, then the small but tall print would immediately clog your nozzle and make the step driver create click sound. If both print ( small and big ) take the same amount of time to clog your nozzle, then it may not cause by &quot;heat creep&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;SO HERE the solution for &quot;heat creep.&quot; First and the most important, replace your thermal barrier tube. Second, lower the temperature. Third, check the filament guide components such as the drive gear, bearing, and spring. For example, check the drive gear if it securely screw into the stepper motor. Lastly, check the fan, if it possible, install another fan to cool down the thermal barrier tube. In conclusion, replace your thermal barrier before doing anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this help for you and for many other people! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alopicaso!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="765" LastActivityDate="2016-03-03T09:12:38.827" CommentCount="0" />

First, not all lasers are equally absorbed by the material and the energy converted to heat to vaporize the material. The light not absorbed is reflected right back into your eyes. This is especially dangerous because it doesn't make you go blind instantly, fooling you into thinking there is no harm. You got the other part right, the lower the laser power, the less turned to heat, the longer it takes to cut, the longer you risk exposure to your eyes. That's right, a low powered laser is MORE dangerous than a big one. Next, the only way to properly cut is with air assist. This means a stream of air blows away the vaporized material so the laser can keep cutting deeper. This also prevents fires. The thing we haven't even touched is a proper safety enclosure, proper bed design to not reflect the laser beam back into the laser killing it and your eyes, and finally smoke/particle exhaust. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, these cheapo DIY lasers are dangerous, and are also illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="810" LastActivityDate="2016-03-03T22:36:26.237" CommentCount="2" />

Regarding your questions: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does lowering the temperature help? Raising it?&lt;/strong&gt; : Yes, lowering the temperature can help. I've found that it is best to stay closer to the lower end of the material's melting point and just a bit above the point. Not only does this help with potential over extrusion, but also shortens the time it takes for the material to cool (refer to the link above). &lt;em&gt;However&lt;/em&gt;, this could cause clogging if your temperature is too low. Keep an eye on your drive gear to see if there is too much friction while at lower temperatures. Increasing may keep the drive gear from &quot;eating&quot; your filament.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does speeding up or slowing down the print head help?&lt;/strong&gt; : I prefer to print slower, most of the time, to allow the material to cool a bit more to avoid curling/warping (I primarily print with ABS, so it matters more). You might be able to give and take between temperature and speed. Consider if your nozzle is cooler and your speed is up, bridging gaps might yield the same results as if you proportionately swap these two values. This concept may only matter if you are in a pinch to get the part done. Again, I prefer slowing my machine down as it allows current/previous layers to cool more before continuing. This can be especially helpful with overhangs when paired with lowering your nozzle temperature.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does increasing/decreasing the extrusion diameter, or layer height help&lt;/strong&gt; - I assume that extrusion diameter equals layer height (not difference in nozzle diameter, aka swapping nozzles). I'm not completely sure, but I think this depends on the part as well as slicing engine settings. For me, MakerWare is pretty good about proportionately adjusting extrusion steps with layer height, so I see an equal change in the width of the extrusion. I would think that in general, a larger layer height would yield a larger extrusion width. This would be helpful when printing overhangs, but may not be helpful when printing bridges (a larger strand will retain heat longer than a smaller one).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this helps, please comment if you need more information/clarification.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastEditorUserId="98" LastEditDate="2016-03-04T17:49:13.747" LastActivityDate="2016-03-04T17:49:13.747" CommentCount="3" />

You need the plastic to solidify before it has a chance to sag. PLA in particular has to shed a lot of heat before it is fully solid. A fan and air guide setup using a &quot;squirrel-cage&quot; radial blower around the nozzle is optimal. A little 30mm or 40mm axial fan will not provide optimal performance. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Low layer height when slicing is less obvious, but is extremely effective. When you use thinner layers, two things happen:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is less melted plastic per pass and a higher surface area to volume ratio, so the fresh material cools faster. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A larger percentage of each strand in the overhang is supported by the previous strand. If you do 0.2mm thick by 0.4mm wide, half of each strand is unsupported. But if you do 0.1mm thick by 0.4mm wide, only a quarter of each strand is unsupported. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you combine these two effects, it is possible to exceed 70 degree overhangs with good surface quality. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another lesser factor is printing shells/perimeters inside-out rather than outside-in. This helps anchor the outermost strand a little better as the overhang is built.
