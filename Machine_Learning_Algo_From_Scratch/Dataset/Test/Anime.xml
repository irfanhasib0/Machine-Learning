Gohan hasn't trained at all since then. We can choose the analogy of professional athletes here: they need to train almost everyday to maintain their form, let alone get &quot;stronger&quot;. After 5 years, it is expected than Gohan has become significantly weaker. But again, if he were to train for a few months, his power would probably go up exponentially. Also note that he did not train much in the Buu saga, much of his power increase came from the help of Supreme Kai.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;...while frieza surpasses goku SSB in 4 months of training&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Frieza states that he never had to train one day in his life because he was already so much stronger than everybody else. If we consider Goku to be a combat genius, imagine how much training and near-deaths experience he had to go through to be able to fight on par with Frieza. In the end, only Krilin's death helped become super saiyan and beat Frieza. Since he never trained before, it would make sense that his power would go up exponentially after little training. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Tagoma was even able to pierce him with a ki blast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the movie &quot;Resurrection of F&quot; Goku in Super Saiyan blue was almost killed by a Sorbet's gun. This tells you that no matter how strong of a warrior you are, you can be defeated by someone so much weaker than you if you are caught by surprise.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;So frieza base is stronger than super saiyan now&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, when Gohan clearly states than he is no match of Frieza, he is still in his base form.

In theory you could make an anime with every single frame having the same level of detail as a painting by Leonardo da Vinci, but it would be prohibitively expensive; it took Leonardo years to finish a single painting, and you would need a whole team of Leonardos churning out thousands of them in a limited timeframe. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, I doubt that it was significantly more expensive to animate Gantz than, say, K-On. The question seems to presuppose that cost is the only thing keeping anime from having more realistic facial art, but I believe it's more about artistry and style. The experience that Gantz was trying to create was drastically different from the experience that K-On was trying to create.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/vSsT5m.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/vSsT5m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;gantz screenshot&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/DHqixm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/DHqixm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;K-on screenshot&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The K-On characters &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; lacking some facial detail compared to the Gantz characters (in line with well-known rules of cuteness that, yes, seriously, have been studied and derived by anthropologists). Gantz uses smaller eyes, chunkier bodies, and a more subdued color palette; this makes it &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; more realistic. However, we can see that both of them are lacking a lot of detail compared with, say, the work of American comics artist Alex Ross.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/1RkMtl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/1RkMtl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Alex Ross&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(I should note that Ross is primarily a cover artist, because of the time it takes him to produce works of such high detail. To create an animated feature at Ross's level of detail would be untenable.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, shows like K-On and Clannad often have very detailed clothes, backgrounds, and other objects. Look at the instruments in K-On.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/oditam.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/oditam.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Azusa with guitar&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/cNbZVm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/cNbZVm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;real guitar&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Look at the detail in the background of this random screenshot from Clannad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/tHh3e.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/tHh3e.png&quot; alt=&quot;clannad kotomi garden&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I don't think the difference in style is primarily about cost. It's about artistry. K-On was well enough funded to make its art look like Gantz had the creators wanted to; but that art style didn't fit with the goals and aesthetic sense of the series. It's the same reason Bugs Bunny looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/iaz2I.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/iaz2I.png&quot; alt=&quot;bugs bunny&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and not like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/S3H02.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/S3H02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;photorealistic rabbit&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the typical anime art style may have originally been created as cost-saving measure, that seems to be no longer the case.

This is unhealthy for Ryuuji, too, as it feeds into his &quot;I have to take care of everything and everyone&quot; mindset, one he got from his own home life. &lt;strong&gt;Taiga leaves to fix her own shit, demonstrating her independence from Ryuuji as a capable person of her own, and Ryuuji accepts and respects her decision despite it hurting him, demonstrating that he acknowledges Taiga is an equal to him and not someone he needs to do everything for.&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;  The scene after the end credits, which you've hopefully watched by now, is almost between two new people. It's one of mature, equal people who truly understand each other.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is never explicitly mentioned in the Light Novel or the anime as to what exactly she did during this time period.

Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Megurine Luka - Fish or Tuna&#xA;Kagamine Rin - Orange(s)&#xA;Kagamine Len - Banana(s)&#xA;KAITO - Ice cream&#xA;MEIKO - Sake (A traditional Japanese alcohol)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;GUMI - Carrot(s)&#xA;Camui/Kamui Gakupo - Eggplant&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(UTAU)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kasane Teto - (French) Bread or a Baguette &#xA;Namine Ritsu - Chocolate Crisps&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So Luka is paired with fish because she has a chibi head character who has hair like an octopus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rin with oranges because Len was paired with Bananas and since they're mirror images, the other closest fruit to him was an orange so they paired Rin with it instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Len was paired with a banana mostly because of his hair color and that piece of his hair sticking upwards resembles a banana, just a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;KAITO with ice cream because fans notice the scarf he wears and in his new V3 update, boots. People thought he seemed to wear winter-special clothes and since his hair is blue it easily resembles snow/ice and relating things, they decided his food was going to be Ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MEIKO with sake because she seemed to look older and mature so I guess they thought it'd be fun if they made her drunk (?)

As a result, you can even absorb energy attacks. As Vegeta said that he mastered the SSG form, I would believe it and would further add that by mastering the form he said that he mastered the perception and usage of the divine Ki, thus making it flow through his body evenly and unlocking the SSGSS form.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is reference to this in the anime when he senses the return of Whis (&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/rM19sHdnvQU?t=3m7s&quot;&gt;watch here&lt;/a&gt;), and later the oracle fish comments that he's finally able to sense divine Ki. Goku even states that Vegeta's Ki had changed a lot during the six months he had spent training under Whis (&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/rM19sHdnvQU?t=4m42s&quot;&gt;watch here&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's similar to that incident when Goku and Gohan had unlocked the Full Power Super Saiyan transformation after training in the hyperbolic time chamber in the cell saga. The FPSSJ transformation was the mastering of SSJ1 and making it the base form, thus reducing the strain on the body and making it easier to raise power levels. What they managed to do can be thought of controlling the SSJ1 Ki and making it flow evenly through their body, thus mastering the form. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The training both Goku and Vegeta are undergoing, which deals with raising power levels, a manifestation of Ki, without letting it leak, or, in other words, letting the opponent know,making each part of the body capable of independent action and also the perception and mastery of divine Ki, thus mastering SSG, SBG (Saiyan Beyond God) and SSB transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="19592" LastEditorUserId="18431" LastEditDate="2015-12-09T20:05:37.347" LastActivityDate="2015-12-09T20:05:37.347" CommentCount="0" />

Yet, the episode seems to say that Black Blade refers to swords turning black when infused with Haki.

Being that Afro is an emotionless murderer, his mind may well have created Ninja Ninja to hold his other emotions excluding Anger and hatred ; He often hangs with Afro as his self-appointed &quot;Road Dog&quot;. Another possible understanding of Ninja-Ninja that would also be relevant to his regular Buddhist inspired spiritual practices is that Ninja Ninja represents Afro's &quot;[Mind&quot;], which tries to affect Afro through voicing doubts and fears. Contrasting Ninja Ninja against Afro's actions in this context gives Afro a different set of characteristics. As to say, he has fears, doubts and anxieties yet continues onward in spite of them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;A canonical reference which you yourself can veruify is the in &lt;strong&gt;Episode 5&lt;/strong&gt;, precisely at &lt;strong&gt;14m 05s&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://afrosamurai.wikia.com/wiki/Justice&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Justice&lt;/a&gt; quotted :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I almost chuckled when you killed that imaginary friend of yours!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Referring to the act where Afro killed Ninja-Ninja but no blood splattered.&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now to add to the wiki, notice the contradictions in the two characters:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Afro&lt;/strong&gt; : Calm, Composed, Risk-taker,lives life on the edge&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ninja Ninja&lt;/strong&gt; : Afraid of all combats, high levels of anxiety, unconfident, slacky, always after them booties&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Noticing these two character differences, its safe to say that Ninja Ninja is the &lt;strong&gt;altered ego&lt;/strong&gt; of the Afro's real self. He's a part of Afro that he himself refuses to acknowledge as a part of himself and treats it as somebody else. Why? Because of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushido&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bushido or the Samurai Code&lt;/a&gt;. He can't allow himself (a samurai) to be unconfident, slacky, pervy or heave a loose attitude. Therefore, he is tempted and warned and mocked by Ninja Ninja time and again, here and there.&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;Another reason I thought of was and which is mentioned in wiki itself is that all the burden of killing and slaughtering mercilessly could drive a person insane! He has to keep his mind off any such distractions. That's is another reason of existence of Ninja Ninja.&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;Now to answer you question as to why he could interact with real world objects :&lt;br/&gt;  He interacted with the same objects that Afro touched.

At the same time Afro was having the steak but he (being a Samurai after all) shouldn't be complaining about such things but his altered ego did it for him to keep Afro calm!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He killed or discarded his Altered ego in ressurrection by dodging a poisoned needle in such a way it hit Ninja-Ninja, and also in the first season he killed it when he was about to face formidable enemies to prevent any second thoughts or distractions!&#xA;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;And I don't remember if he was ever noticed by any other character in the anime.(Tell me on which episode at what time if I'm mistaken)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope this seems reasonable!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="14105" LastActivityDate="2015-12-13T13:39:37.873" CommentCount="0" />

Bara-Suishou and Kanaria are introduced in the first and third episodes of &lt;em&gt;Träumend,&lt;/em&gt; respectively. During episode 1 of &lt;em&gt;Träumend&lt;/em&gt;, Shinku explicitly refers to herself as the fifth Rozen Maiden doll, and Bara-Suishou answers to the seventh.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In episode 1 of the OVA &lt;em&gt;Ouvertüre&lt;/em&gt;, we learn that Shinku then only knew about three Rozen Maiden dolls at the time of &lt;em&gt;Ouvertüre.&lt;/em&gt; However, for some reason, she knows that there should be seven. Also in that episode, Shinku gets to know Suigintou for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt; She finds out, that Suigintou is broken and initially does not even have a &lt;em&gt;Rosa Mystica&lt;/em&gt; thus concluding that she shouldn’t be a Rozen Maiden. However in the second OVA episode, Suigintou has been restored after defeat and granted a &lt;em&gt;Rosa Mystica,&lt;/em&gt; obviously making her a true Rozen Maiden.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In episode 12 of &lt;em&gt;Träumend,&lt;/em&gt; we learn that&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt; Bara-Suishou was not an original &lt;em&gt;Rozen Maiden&lt;/em&gt; but rather an &lt;em&gt;Enju Maiden&lt;/em&gt; being crafted by a different doll maker. It is not clearly revealed as far as I can tell whether she has a &lt;em&gt;Rosa Mystica&lt;/em&gt; but she cannot cope with winning the Alice game and thus the other six girls’ &lt;em&gt;Rosa Mysticas,&lt;/em&gt; possibly because she is not pure enough. In any case, the situation is restored to a pre-Alice-game situation where only those dolls defeated by Rozen Maidens stay defeated: Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki (by Shinku and Suigintou).&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA; I conclude from these facts, that Bara-Suishou is quite a bit younger than the other dolls.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the dolls must somehow know that there are seven of them but not who they are until they met each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why did they know that they must be seven?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How and why did they know the how many-th doll they are?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt; How was it possible that &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; of the six met the seventh &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt; Rozen Maiden in the over 100 years that they had been living and fighting all over the world, so that they all assumed Bara-Suishou to be the proper seventh?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt; Shouldn’t there have been any clues for the other dolls that Bara-Suishou is ‘non-canonical’? E.g. the scene at the end of &lt;em&gt;Träumend&lt;/em&gt; 10 where they meet Enju and call him &lt;em&gt;father.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="13532" LastEditorUserId="6481" LastEditDate="2015-12-16T08:38:35.737" LastActivityDate="2015-12-16T08:38:35.737" Title="How and how much do the dolls know about the other dolls?"

This is true, and each of these parts is a season. However, there aren't always exactly 13 days of each day of the week in season. For example, the summer 2016 season (July-September) will have 14 Saturdays.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to why shows go for 12 or 13 episodes, it's generally something the anime production companies decide early on in creating an anime (a few months prior to the show airing). Different studios and shows will have their reasons, but either way, there we are. Unless we were there when the decision was made in some board room, we don't know why a show got 12 episodes over 13.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the planned season where the show will be airing is about to start, the anime production companies will call the TV stations and ask for time slots. (Generally, TV stations themselves aren't involved in producing anime, only just putting them on TV.) For example, one will call to say &quot;we want to air a show on Saturday nights at 24:30 for the next 12 Saturdays&quot;. Another will call asking &quot;we want to air a show on Thursday nights at 24:00 for the next 13 Thursdays&quot;. Whether or not they get the slot depends entirely upon whether or not someone else took it yet (and if the price for the slot is worth it).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anime TV scheduling is competitive, as is a number of things in the anime production world. Anime production companies will try to be as quick as they can about getting a TV slot, but it usually isn't until relatively close to the start of the anime season that TV stations get a full schedule figured out. TV stations can count on their slots being filled, though, with the wide amount of anime coming out each season nowadays (and they can always rely on reruns otherwise).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, to sum it up, anime production companies know from early on how many episodes they want. How they decide that is dependent upon the show. When it comes to the TV stations, they just offer up the time slots, that's it.

When a voice actor passes away, an anime studio may already have the next 2, 3, or so episodes already animated in some form, and even more with a written script; to go back and change all those drawings/animations to write out a character is time-consuming and expensive. Frankly, it has to be someone much more crucial to the show's production to die for the companies to begin even considering these options.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="16539" LastActivityDate="2015-12-16T11:01:00.483" CommentCount="0" />

I've noticed that half demons in the show can lean towards either being more like their human side or demon side. Jinenji and Inuyasha would lead towards their human sides with their love for their human mothers whom raised them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Naraku on the other hand chose his demon side through and through which is only displayed so surely whenever we see him try to suppress or throw away Onigumo's human feelings for Kikyo. As such, his becoming full demon in power has little effect on his mind because he's already using that side's state of mind to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because Inuyasha's demon blood was never trained properly and said blood is so potent to begin with, his more baser instincts are what come out when it over powers his human side. (This potency and his expected death is actually why Inuyasha's father had Tetsaiga passed on to Inuyasha because he knew the results that would come if his demon blood overpowered his human blood in life or death situations) Demons are much more blood thirsty than humans, paticularly those lower class and weaker demons who have not developed a higher order of thinking which is why they are often referred to a little more than &quot;savage beasts&quot;.

Just look at his resume: Raditz, the Saiyans, Frieza and all his minions, and then Cell. I stop at Cell because that was the last time he seriously trained for any sustained amount of time. But even after that, he stopped training for 7 years and his power decreased to the point where he was &quot;only&quot; a little stronger than Perfect Cell. During the Buu saga, the Old Kaioshin just unlocked the rest of his dormant power. So with all he experienced when he was a kid, it's only natural that he'd be a formidable fighter regardless of how much he's let himself go.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as Goten goes, he was being trained by Chichi. She might not be very powerful herself compared to the Z fighters, but she's certainly the strongest female in the world aside from 18. Her training methods were never really discussed but from the one flashback of her sparring with Goten, we can see that she was going pretty hard on him so it wouldn't be too far fetched to think that she'd be able to make him powerful. Like Gohan, he has the hidden power, so it's just a matter of training. The main difference is that Chichi allows Goten to train whereas Gohan had to either sneak off for that or there had to be something threatening Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long explanation but I hope that helps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="19910" LastActivityDate="2015-12-23T06:02:24.797" CommentCount="0" />

In BoG, Gohan was probably still the strongest or at least on the same level as Goku before he goes SSJG, hence the reason why they made it a point to have him step in as if he was the only one who could stop Beerus. Obviously, that didn't work out too well for him. But he powered up into his &quot;mystic&quot; form and that's the last time we see it, so far. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't see how he could have fallen so far behind Goku and Vegeta prior to their being trained by Whis, but basically Gohan hasn't trained, like at all. Not like the time between when he fought Cell and Majin Buu where he just slacks on his training—this time he really did nothing at all. The most &quot;training&quot; you see him do is when he's play fighting with Mr. Satan as Great Saiyaman over baby Pan. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They do make it a point to show that he hasn't necessarily lost his power, as he's able to easily beat Ginyu (in Tagoma's body) as a Super Saiyan, just the ability to access all of it at will without seriously injuring or killing himself has been lost. Against Frieza, he may have been able to fight with him and at least hold him off till Goku and Vegeta got there, but we all saw what bringing out more power than his body can handle did to him. Think Kaioken and what happened to Goku when he fought Vegeta, except on a much larger scale. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They also made it a point to show that maybe he wasn't necessarily &quot;too weak&quot; to face Frieza, just too soft. He lets his guard down while showing mercy to Ginyu in the same way Goku did with Frieza and pays for it with a ki blast through the shoulder. Given that he was clearly angry with himself for letting his training go, which made him unable to protect his family, maybe he's learned his lesson about just assuming his dad or Vegeta will always be there to protect everyone and will find some motivation to train a little bit. We'll see. My point is that they seem to be putting raw power into a grey area and focusing more on ability, experience and fighting spirit in this series. That's just my opinion based on the fact that Roshi was there fighting when Yamcha is easily at least still stronger than he is. Anyway, I hope that helps anyone wondering what's happening with Gohan.

Or why he lied to Suzaku about ordering Euphie to kill the Japanese. So I spent hours trying to come up with a theory, and I ended up with this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that Lelouch had planned for Suzaku to kill him all along. If he had admitted that he didn't mean to make Euphie kill the Japanese, Suzaku would be unable to kill Lelouch. In order for the Zero Requiem to succeed, Lelouch had to die. And Lelouch trusted nobody more than Suzaku, even when they were enemies. After all, he frequently said that there was nothing they couldn't do together.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many people have wondered if Lelouch really did use the Black Knights. I believe this is partly true and partly false. When he was confronted by the Black Knights after they heard the recorded conversation between Lelouch and Suzaku, he told them that everything he had done was for his entertainment, and that the Black Knights were just pawns to him. I think he did this to protect the Black Knights-if they believed they were worthless to him they would have no reason to rescue him now that Schneizel knew his identity. This would protect the Black Knights. This implies that he cared for them and did not use them.&#xA;However, the Black Knights were essential to his plan, as he was relying on them to create a better world once he died. So he couldn't afford for them to collapse and be defeated. This could be seen as using them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I guess Lelouch is evil, but he is fighting on the side of justice-he is willing to sacrifice his humanity for the greater good. And an evil hero is still a hero. And as Suzaku realised at last, it's the end result that matters, not the means of getting there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope you consider and expand my theory, and I hope this answers the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24273" LastActivityDate="2016-05-24T20:27:19.613" CommentCount="0" />

I don't know why he would have changed that between the manga release and the anime.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I won't deny that her pants in the anime are cream-colored and seem to be tighter fitting, which definitely makes it look like she's not wearing anything under her skirt:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/IEfUQ.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/IEfUQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have seen the DVD release and can also attest that this is the same in the DVD. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://from-the-sidelines.blogspot.com/2013/04/nausicaa-of-valley-of-wind-1984.html&quot;&gt;this review&lt;/a&gt;, it's actually the Blu-ray release that cleans up the colors:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Having never acquired the DVD release of Nausicaä due to it being a low priority. The faded quality of the version I first saw years ago probably had a lot to do with it. In 2011, Disney released the Blu-ray and last year I decided to fill a gap in my collection. That turned out to be a great decision.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Disney’s first Studio Ghibli Blu-ray release includes the movie on DVD and is of the digitally restored version. Suffice it to say this is the best the movie has ever looked in the States. The movie is presented in anamorphic widescreen in 1.85:1 ratio for both discs while the Blu-ray is in 1080p High Definition.    &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It is absolutely gorgeous with the colors finally being faithful. This is important due to prior releases making it look like Nausicaä wasn’t wearing any pants or underwear! The color of her pants were too close to the skin tone used and got lost in the mastering before this release.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asianblurayguide.com/capture/1707/nausicaa_of_the_valley_of_the_wind_anime_japan/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a gallery of images from the Blu-ray release. We can see that, while the pants are still not as white as in the manga, they are definitely a different shade from her face:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/sKOfr.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/sKOfr.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't say that Ghibli films have &quot;a bias against prudishness&quot;. They'll show underwear or a bath scene if it makes sense to show it, but by anime standards, they're quite sparing with nudity and sexual themes. Miyazaki himself is usually considered a feminist; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitchmedia.org/post/feminism-miyazaki-and-spirited-away-movie-princess-mononoke&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is one of many articles I found praising the feminist themes in his work. Even without all the other evidence, it just doesn't feel in character for Miyazaki to draw a heroine with no pants and no underwear running around exposing her naked rear end through an entire movie. So even if all we had was the DVD release and didn't have the Blu-ray or manga to suggest it to us, my vote would still go to &quot;no, she's wearing pants&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7579" LastActivityDate="2016-05-26T05:05:17.543" CommentCount="0" />

Any AF dōjinshi, should they even exist, occupy the same canonical status as fan fiction and fan art. Akira Toriyama publicly stated that he had no intention of continuing the series (which he finished in 1995), though he has drawn a &quot;parody&quot; series, Nekomajin, in which several Dragon Ball characters appear, a one-shot crossover between Dragon Ball and One Piece, in collaboration with One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda, entitled Cross Epoch, and the OVA Dragon Ball: Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!!. Toriyama also oversaw production of Dragon Ball GT and played a major role in the character designs of Dragon Ball Online.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The Dragon Ball fansite Daizenshuu EX has created a specifically-designed list[4] of the features of AF that should disprove its existence to the especially obstinate. These are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Lack of advertising in Japanese media.&#xA;  This point includes print sources (such as the Japanese Shonen Jump), TV ads, and official Japanese websites. Since Dragon Ball is well-known throughout Japan, a sequel series would not be released unpromoted, nor would it go unnoticed by the Japanese population. Daizenshuu EX took advantage of this fact, however, as part of its 2004 April Fool's joke, creating both a &quot;print ad&quot; and a &quot;TV commercial&quot; from other sources. This material, bereft of its context, has since been cited as &quot;evidence&quot; for the existence of AF.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Lack of official announcements by Toriyama, Shueisha, or Toei Animation.&#xA;  Tying in to the idea of &quot;advertising&quot; above, none of the official Japanese sources of Dragon Ball material have come forward with any news on the scale of AF. Such a series would warrant at least a comment, if not an elaborately-staged introduction, from one or more of these entities. Of course, this has not stopped fans from claiming that such an announcement has already taken place (though there is no record of one ever occurring).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Lack of articles, previews, or reviews of the series, in Japanese magazines or online blogs.&#xA;  Note, however, that some Japanese fans have taken to commenting on the AF phenomenon outside of Japan, and this may be regarded as commentary on the &quot;series&quot; itself by those who do not speak Japanese. Indeed, the language barrier has often been a source of obfuscation, both for those who would believe the rumors, and those whose goal is to spread them further.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Lack of scans from manga releases or screen captures/movie clips from new episodes.&#xA;  While many &quot;faked&quot; images (generally produced as humorous commentary on the rumors, or outside of AF but incorporated into it accidentally) do exist, there are no raw manga scans or unaltered screenshots available, anywhere. Particularly good artwork may be mistakenly viewed as &quot;promotional art,&quot; but no media from within the manga/anime exists. Therefore, the burden of proof is on those who claim they own the series to put forth something they cannot possibly have (calls for such individuals to show whatever material they have are usually met by excuses or ad-hominem attacks).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Lack of scanlations or fansubs.&#xA;  Ethical and legal issues aside, a series as popular as Dragon Ball would not long remain without a fan-translated version. The methods of digital distribution are such that it would be virtually impossible not to find such materials, even in a casual search. Neither of these two things exists, however.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Lack of official merchandise.&#xA;  Dragon Ball is, and always has been, heavily marketed commercially. In Japan, a multitude of items, from action figures, to snacks, soundtracks, stationery, desks, and even children's eyedrops, have been sold as Dragon Ball products or endorsed by characters from the series. The lack of official AF merchandise, then, is a strong indicator that such a series does not in fact exist.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Official denial by both Viz Media and FUNimation Entertainment.&#xA;  Such denials would run counter to the financial interests of both of these companies (the distributors of Dragon Ball manga and anime in the United States) were the rumors to be true. It is highly unlikely that they would categorically dismiss a property that could make them millions of dollars.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Ball_AF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Ball_AF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit: why is this down voted?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24317" LastEditorUserId="24317" LastEditDate="2016-06-01T09:42:56.907" LastActivityDate="2016-06-01T09:42:56.907" CommentCount="2" />

Notice how its shikai form is smaller that its normal form, unlike the previous two examples, which is why I said that Zanpakutou's size reflects the spiritual power is generall true. Also, so far she has never been see using her Zanpakutou in its normal, unreleased state.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another exception to this is Kurosaki Ichigo. Kurosaki Ichigo's Zanpakutou is always in its shikai form. But its bankai form actually made the blade smaller, and denser, unlike bankai in general, which was noted by Kuchiki Byakuya during their fight. Byakuya also said that he don't believe that such a small sword (compared to Ichigo's shikai and bankai in general) can be his bankai.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;As mentioned by Ryan and Memor-X, Zanpakutou's size can be controlled. This was mentioned by Kurosaki Isshin to Grand Fisher, that if Zanpakutou's size is not controlled, those with huge Spiritual Power like the Captains, would literally have skyscrapers on their hands. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Answer to Question 2&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Normally, a shinigami is given an Asauchi, a blank Zanpakutou created by the creator of Asauchi, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/%C5%8Cetsu_Nimaiya&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ouetsu Nimaiya&lt;/a&gt;. This blank Zanpakutou will develop along with its wielder and make itself unique. This is how Shinigami normally got their Zanpakutou. Therefore, since all Zanpakutou (with the exception of Zangetsu) was an Asauchi, it can be said that it existed generations before the current generation of Shinigami).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Answer to Question 3&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kurosaki Ichigo's Zanpakutou, Zangetsu, is special since Ichigo is a son of Shinigami and Quincy. His father, Kurosaki Isshin is a Shinigami and his mother was a Quincy.

In that effect, the sword does exist before the shinigami. It is this base form that can change size to refelct the spiritual pressure of the wielder. Ichigo was the example, his power was so great that when he took Rukia's Asauchi, it grew to that large size he initially had.

Taken from the Refernce&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;No matter what form (or size) a Zanpakutō takes, it is always virtually effortless for its owner to wield because it is a part of its owner's soul. Shinigami captains all consciously keep their Zanpakutō in a manageable size, or else they would be holding Zanpakutō the size of skyscrapers, so one cannot judge the strength of one's opponent solely by the size of their Zanpakutō&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So normal shinigami and evne seated officers do not have a massive amount of power and therefor their swords are of normal sizes. Once you reach high ranked officers and capitains, then the sizes are naturally so massive that they must control and contain it, Else it would be the size of a skyscraper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Shikai and bankai come from the Zanpaktou spirit. They in effect are a part of the Shinigami's soul, so they can not exist before the Shinigami. It is throuhg time and pouring their power into an asauchi that it turns into a complete zanpaktou and obtains Shikai and Bankai forms. Realistically, these guys can live separately from their owner Shinigami if forcefully taken from their souls, but will never do so themselves. It is however unknown what happens to the Asauchi at this point, and whether it can ever revert back to its regular form for another Shinigami or not is unclear. what is clear however is that the Shikai and Bankai forms are of Set sizes. No matter how much power the capitains grew in, their Shikai and Bankai did not change size. Mayuri Kurotsuchi even modified his bankai and could change its size though that, as well as when new forms of the Shikai and Bankai are revealed, but at no time could The shinigami ever change its actual size at will.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ichigo himself is a special case, because of his blood and situation. In any case, his Zanpaktou and other powers did not exist before him. He however only had an Asauchi when he borrowed it from Rukia. He never used Shikai in that form, but we know the Asauchi can be used by anyone, which is what ichigo did. Once he reawakend his powers with Urahara, he no longer had an Asauchi and his zanpaktou itself formed without it, Though because it was not from an Asauchi, how much of a zanpaktou it really was after that is unknown. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="20610" LastActivityDate="2016-05-27T18:30:51.153" CommentCount="0" />

It can happen for any reason, but a common reason is when a man marries into a family with no sons and his wife’s family wants to keep their name going.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In modern Japan, married couples are required to pick one partner’s family name for both of them. From &lt;a href=&quot;http://time.com/3940094/maiden-married-names-countries/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a Time article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In contrast, Japan requires that married couples take one of the spouses’ family names, which, unsurprisingly, means that 96% of married Japanese women assume their husband’s last name.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any children of the marriage are given that last name as well, so if the couple chooses to use the wife’s name, the children will have their mother’s family name.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In anime, of course, this is used as a plot device, and the exact reason depends on the show. For instance, in Evangelion, Gendou takes Yui’s last name, Ikari, to try and distance himself from some of the unsavory things he did in the past. So Shinji gets his mother’s name, which might have various meanings, given all the Freudian subtext in the show. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7579" LastActivityDate="2016-05-28T16:32:50.020" CommentCount="1" />

A good example is the death of &lt;a href=&quot;http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Matsushiro_Nakaokaji&quot;&gt;Matsushiro Nakaokaji&lt;/a&gt;, a robber and murderer who is killed by Light who writes that the target bleeds to death at 1:30 p.m.  He was stabbed by a store employee and winds up dying at the prescribed time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/M5fIS.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/M5fIS.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Death of Matsushiro Nakaokaji&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This establishes that, yes, assuming the conditions are feasible (see in particular LV.1-2), you can use the Death Note to manipulate someone other than the victim into killing them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Death by a best friend stabbing&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean in practice?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, likely Bob's best friend has to have considered stabbing him, which seems fairly likely, based on the lose definition of potential outlined in the rules regarding suicide.  Also, the friend likely has to be physically present and have an accessible knife to ensure feasibility (most homes would meet this criteria as they have knives in the kitchen).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it is feasible, the next question is whether the attack will somehow result in the friend dying as well.  If so, Rules X.2 and XVI.2 clearly state Bob will instead die of a heart attack, to prevent additional deaths. Note that Rule XLLII.1 state that it's fine to short the characters lifespan (let's say Bob fights back and stabs the friend with a non-life ending injury that nonetheless shortens his life, i.e. laceration of the spleen or kidney).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now let's assume that it's not feasible for that best friend, either because they're not capable of harboring such thoughts, are physical incapable (maybe they're paralyzed), or would die in the process of the attack.  Then that friend will definitely not commit the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does Bob have multiple best friends?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If so, likely the above criteria repeats.  If one best friend would die  from the stabbing, perhaps the situation will pass to a friend that meets the feasibility criteria and wouldn't die.  So maybe best friend 1 is a nerd and best friend 2 is a gym rat... the note would likely avoid the nerdy friend who would die of the counterattack, and instead pick the gym rat, who could carry out the deed without dying himself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unknowns include which best friend is chosen first and how/why, assuming there's multiple &quot;best friends&quot; of Bob capable of killing him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Death by someone else stabbing him or some accident causing bleeding&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now if no friends are capable of killing him, than the next question, per LV.1-2 is whether someone else would be capable of stabbing him.  Say he's at the store at 13:30 p.m. and no friends are around, but other people are and one of them has a knife.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, assuming no one else but Bob will die as a result of the attack and the attacker has considered stabbing a random stranger (or casual acquaintance if they happen to know Bob), then the stabbing may still occur, just not the written situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or something else will happen to Bob (i.e. a piano falling on his leg) that causes him to bleed out at the specified time.  The requirement of no additional deaths, however, would precluding many accidents that might satisfy this end, though (think massive highway crash, etc., which would likely produce multiple fatalities).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there's multiple possibilities to fulfill the cause of death, if the situation was deemed infeasible or would lead to additional deaths, it's unclear which would be picked (as with the question of which best friend would kill him if multiple are capable).

Now basically, to mould chakra one needs to mould the Physical and Spiritual energies within ourselves in the right combination. The spiritual energy is the Yin form(or Yin release) and the Physical energy the yang release. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hence, the Yin release is nothing but the Spiritual energy that Shinobis use ,can be used in a wide variety of forms.

I don't understand where half these answers are coming from, as a naruto fan for over 11 years now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tsunade:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I saw someone speak of Tsunade's strong taijutsu. Tsunade is a horribly weak fighter. The reason she's can punch so hard is because of her chakra control, which she fully explained to Sakura in the training flashbacks. Mind you, that she was &lt;em&gt;losing to Kabuto&lt;/em&gt;. It was often stated that Kabuto was &lt;em&gt;&quot;Just on Kakashi's level&quot;&lt;/em&gt;. Meanwhile, Kabuto was one of the strongest people in the series. Don't forget that Tsunade is a medic and not a fighter. She's exceptional as a medic, not as a fighter. As a fighter she's just your everyday jounin level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jiraiya:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;I saw someone answer about his taijutsu as well, stating it's so strong because of his Frog Kimute. Well, he can only use that in sage mode. Either way, I do believe Jiraiya was the strongest of the sannin and would indeed quite easily beat Kakashi. There is simply no doubt about this... or is there? The fact is that these people know each other well. If Jiraiya wouldn't know about Kakashi's sharingan, specifically his &quot;I'm gonna shoot you into another dimension!&quot; trick, He'd probably lose by surprise. Kakashi is an assassin type ninja and would almost always win a fight when it came to trickery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orochimaru:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm quite sure Orochimaru would win, simply because he's pretty much immortal. He has a lot of very dirty tricks and Kakashi wouldn't have the chakra/stamina to keep up the fight. Without that, Kakashi would probably win, though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obito:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obito would probably kick Kakashi's ass, but he would also kick the asses of the Sannin. People like Orochimaru posed no threat to him at all. Obito is super OP. besides this, his Sharingan is way stronger than Kakashi's.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Itachi:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kakashi would simply lose to Itachi. Itachi is possibly the strongest character to have ever existed. A lot of people tend to say &quot;Aside from Obito/Madara&quot;, but I disagree. Itachi was the most genius ninja ever known to anyone, as far as we know. All we have seen from Itachi was a display of power while he was dying. We have, not once, seen Itachi go full power. His Susanoo's was so strong for a reason, though. Although Madara is sickeningly OP, I wouldn't be so sure that Obito is stronger than Itachi, let alone Kakashi.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kakashi himself:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that Kakashi's power hasn't been extremely stable throughout the series. Kakashi is known for having a laughably small chakra pool. Pretty much every genin we've seen has had a bigger chakra pool than Kakashi, especially when he uses his Sharingan.&#xA;Having said that, Kakashi is known for being a tactical genius. He's an assassin-type ninja, and would kill nearly anyone if he, for once, was the ambusher. He analyses every situation perfectly and always finds a great plan to deal with it.&#xA;That being said, absurdly OP people like orochimaru and Itachi wouldn't be bothered by it, as orochimaru immortal and Itachi is just as much a genius as Kakashi is, if not even more so. Basically, Kakashi would win almost any fight if he was the one to initiate it and his opponent would actually die from having their hearts deleted... :P&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;-- my final conlusion is: No, Kakashi did not surpass them in the sense of all-round power, but he did surpass them in a strategical sense. Basically, you'd want Kakashi as your team-leader, where as Jiraiya should be the one he's bossing around. Kakashi is basically the boogeyman.

Disclaimer 1: I'm assuming that these passages are appearing as the creators intended and we don't have a case like the disaster in the Del Rey release of Negima Volume 6, where we had appendices full of complete nonsense being passed off as Greek because the translators had tried to transliterate the Greek into the Roman alphabet based on Akamatsu's transliteration of the Greek into katakana.

No one believes the reconstructed phonology is 100% correct, or even 90% correct. But what we see here is too far off base to be taken seriously as an attempt to write Sumerian according to a reconstructed phonology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;You can see where they cribbed from&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whatever language this is, it includes the English words &lt;em&gt;various&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;coffin&lt;/em&gt;, as well as &lt;em&gt;killter&lt;/em&gt;, which looks a lot like &lt;em&gt;kilter&lt;/em&gt;, as in &quot;off kilter&quot;. The word &lt;em&gt;baral&lt;/em&gt; in the swan song looks like it comes from Hebrew בלל (balal), which &lt;a href=&quot;http://biblehub.com/hebrew/1101.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;means &quot;to confuse&quot; or &quot;to mix&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abarim-publications.com/Meaning/Babel.html#.V1SxLZPyuRs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;apparently the source of the word &quot;Babel&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. It uses the English form of &lt;em&gt;ziggurat&lt;/em&gt;; the Akkadian form is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziggurat&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;ziqqurat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while &quot;ziggurat&quot; comes from the Hebrew form &lt;a href=&quot;https://glosbe.com/en/he/ziggurat&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;זיגוראט (zygwrʼt)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That doesn't automatically disqualify it as a real language; after all, in the Australian language Mbabaram, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbabaram_language#Word_for_.22dog.22&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;dog&lt;/em&gt; means &quot;dog&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. But, combined with the widespread use of English for mysterious and exotic things in anime, this makes me highly suspicious of any claim that the sentences are Sumerian or any other language. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, the sentences conform remarkably well to English phonology. Almost all of these words are easily pronounceable to an English speaker. The ones that look a little weird, like &lt;em&gt;zeios&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;rei&lt;/em&gt;, show some pretty clear Japanese influence. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Machine systems can't make heads or tails of it&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I fed all the activation chants and the swan song to Google Translate and &lt;a href=&quot;http://labs.translated.net/language-identifier/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Translated.net Labs's language detector&lt;/a&gt;, both together and individually. I wasn't expecting it to translate them, but I was hoping it would detect what language they were.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a side note, machine translation still sucks, but this kind of language detection is supposed to be pretty good; Russel and Norvig claim in &lt;em&gt;Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach&lt;/em&gt; that computer systems can identify languages, even based on short texts like &quot;Hello world&quot; and &quot;Wie geht es dir&quot;, with greater than 99% accuracy (&lt;em&gt;AIMA&lt;/em&gt; 3ed., page 862). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;None of these systems can detect Sumerian or Akkadian, but they can detect most modern languages, even some quite obscure ones. The general consensus was that the activation chants have a Germanic flavor (Google Translate pegged them as English, even after I deleted the words &lt;em&gt;various&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;coffin&lt;/em&gt;, while another service took them as Frisian, a Germanic language closely related to English), while the swan song was taken as Indonesian. Google Translate insisted that both texts together were English, while Translated.net took both texts together as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundanese_language&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sundanese&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For comparison, I took a passage from Shakespeare's &lt;em&gt;Titus Andronicus&lt;/em&gt; and a few lines from The Who's &quot;Call Me Lighting&quot;, shoved them together, and fed them to Translated.net:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;so, so; now sit: and look you eat no more&#xA;  than will preserve just so much strength in us&#xA;  as will revenge these bitter woes of ours.&#xA;  marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot:&#xA;  thy niece and i, poor creatures, want our hands,&#xA;  and cannot passionate our tenfold grief&#xA;  with folded arms. this poor right hand of mine&#xA;  is left to tyrannize upon my breast;&#xA;  who, when my heart, all mad with misery,&#xA;  beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,&#xA;  then thus i thump it down.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;hey little girl who's dancing so lightly,  my xke is shining so brightly,  the noose around us is slowly tightening,  i'm gonna show you why they call me lightning&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;English, English, and more English. It defies my suspension of disbelief to think that if these passages were all the same language, there would be so much confusion about what language that was. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what algorithm Google Translate uses; Translated.net seems to use some kind of nearest neighbors algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The &quot;translations&quot; are absurd&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The translation of Ichaival's chant seems to have been removed from the wikia sometime between when this question was asked and now, which probably doesn't say much for its authenticity. But let's take a look at the one in the OP:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Killter ichaival tron&lt;/em&gt; -&gt; Evening draws in the awakened Ichaival&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since all the chants end with &lt;em&gt;tron&lt;/em&gt;, that has to be something that makes sense in every chant. Based on the context, I'm going to say that has to be &quot;awakened&quot;; it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an activation song, so it makes sense that they would all be &quot;awakened&quot;. So &lt;em&gt;Ichaival tron&lt;/em&gt; means &quot;awakened Ichaival&quot;. So we can postulate that this language puts modifiers after nouns, like Spanish and Irish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then what does &lt;em&gt;killter&lt;/em&gt; mean? It has to mean &lt;em&gt;evening draws in&lt;/em&gt;. But this is linguistically absurd; it violates &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constituent_(linguistics)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;constituent structure&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;draws in&lt;/em&gt; is a verb, while &lt;em&gt;evening&lt;/em&gt; is a noun. &lt;em&gt;killter&lt;/em&gt; can't literally mean &lt;em&gt;evening draws in&lt;/em&gt; in a real language (if it does, we've got the makings of a real whopper of a paper in theoretical syntax here—it'll be almost to theoretical syntax what those particles that traveled faster than light would have been to relativity). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;killter&lt;/em&gt; therefore must mean either &lt;em&gt;evening&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;draws in&lt;/em&gt;, with the other element implied or indicated in some way by the morphology. So we have a language where you can just say &lt;em&gt;draws in&lt;/em&gt;, and everyone automatically assumes you meant &lt;em&gt;evening draws in&lt;/em&gt;, or a language where you can just say &lt;em&gt;evening&lt;/em&gt;, and everyone assumes you meant &lt;em&gt;evening draws in&lt;/em&gt;. Some languages, at least in their poetry, do allow you to get incredibly terse like this. Still...I'm not buying it. It reminds me too much of &lt;a href=&quot;http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/auldelv.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Helge K Fauskanger's analysis of Auld Elvish from &lt;em&gt;Bored of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not convinced these are passages from a real language, or even from a somewhat sensible conlang like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://conlang.wikia.com/wiki/Hymmnos&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hymnos language&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;em&gt;Ar Tonelico&lt;/em&gt; series.

Note, both of these scenes take place after Miki is killed and Akira withdraws into his subconscious and is lingering/thinking over the special moments he had with Miki or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="25510" LastEditorUserId="1908" LastEditDate="2016-06-06T03:53:35.563" LastActivityDate="2016-06-06T03:53:35.563" Title="What is the name of this background song that plays in Amon: The Darkside of The Devilman?"

Plates with black text on a yellow background are used for &quot;light vehicles&quot; (sometimes glossed in English as &quot;&lt;em&gt;kei&lt;/em&gt; car&quot; from 軽 &lt;em&gt;kei&lt;/em&gt; &quot;light&quot;).

The five &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goodcarbadcar.net/2016/02/usa-best-selling-cars-january-2016-sales-figures.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;top-selling cars in the U.S. as of January 2016&lt;/a&gt; were the Toyota Camry (2500+ cc), Honda Civic (1500+ cc), Toyota Corolla (1800+ cc), Nissan Altima (2500+ cc), and Honda Accord (2400+ cc). And these are all reasonably-sized sedans, not Hummer-esque monstrosities (6000+ cc). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These cars are fairly popular in Japan (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zenkeijikyo.or.jp/statistics/ken_share/1503ken_share4.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;as of Mar 2015&lt;/a&gt;, 39% of all vehicles in Japan were light vehicles; this is up from 26% &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zenkeijikyo.or.jp/statistics/ken_share/9803ken_share4.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;in 1998&lt;/a&gt;), for reasons apparently having to do with how Japan taxes and regulates vehicles. They also sell reasonably well in South/Southeast Asia. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would agree with Nori that light vehicles are conservative, primarily because they're often &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%E8%BB%BD%E8%87%AA%E5%8B%95%E8%BB%8A&amp;amp;tbm=isch&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;rather boxy and unattractive&lt;/a&gt; (because of the size restrictions) and because they accelerate slowly and generally have poor &quot;performance&quot; (because of the small engine). They seem to have many benefits, especially in urban environments (easier parking and maneuvering; lower taxes and cheaper insurance; better gas mileage; and apparently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kuruvia.com/articles/knowledges/17/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;there's less bureaucracy involved in registering one&lt;/a&gt;).

Unwilling or unable to accept that, he decided to wait for her to return, which from the Afterlife School rules would require her to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Die during her teenage years (13 to 17 or so for a 4 year gap)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Have a heavy regret&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the girl lived an average of 85 years and reincarnated each time, there would be a 4/85 (teenage years)*9.83/1000(Japan death rate )*1%(Ad hoc chance of heavy regret)=~0.0004% every reincarnation. Each failure to hit this chance would lead to 85 years of waiting. A 10% chance to see her again would require 2.125 million years.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The above calculations do not consider that the majority of the death rate is actually from the elderly rather than from teenagers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;As expected, the amount stunned Yuri, due to the massive time required to be spent waiting. The AI explained that The Programmer lost his grip on sanity after waiting so long, and decided to create a program to turn himself into an NPC.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;As The Programmer felt that people who had resolved their sadness should not clutter the Afterlife School (much like patients should be discharged when they are cured rather than staying in the hospital), he created a program that kept track of the amount of love in the Afterlife School world. &lt;strong&gt;When the amount of love exceeded a certain amount, a &quot;cleaning&quot; program would be activated where NPCs would be changed into Shadows, which would in turn target humans and forcibly change them into NPCs, thus resetting the world into one where no humans existed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(formatting mine)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;So, who is the Programmer?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Theories are welcome if they're backed up with facts.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="18582" LastEditorUserId="18582" LastEditDate="2016-06-11T20:47:30.080" LastActivityDate="2016-06-11T20:47:30.080" Title="Who is the mysterious Programmer of Angel Beats?"

But fans are really passionate about it So here's my answer. There is no real point in it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is shown quite clearly that BB needs to be touching the user to negate the DF powers (Whitebeard and Ace fights). So in order for a DF user to swim, &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;BB sits in a boat, holds one arm or touches the body of DF user. The boat has to follow the same exact path and speed of the swimmer and the instant BB loses the touch DF user drowns and BB can't save him. Unless the boat can just have 1 pirate on it, I'd rather just row.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;BB himself can't swim being a DF user. He will lose strength and from what I know the Yami Yami no Mi power is not auto triggered.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus only plausible scenario is&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;That BB can maintain his DF fruit power even when he is submerged in water, and then a DF fruit user can carry him across water.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think 3 is improbable since Crocodile did say that he has trained himself to turn into sand.

Let's not forget that alongside the original ending of Angel Beats, Key issued another epilogue, aptly titled &quot;Another Epilogue&quot;. In this, the main focus is another person that's arrived in the Afterlife, and he is surrounded by quiet, obedient NPCs. After challenging the reality of the Afterlife School, he is talked to by the Student Council President,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt; The Otonashi in an alternate timeline, who hasn't moved on yet,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and he is told that if he has any questions about the world that they both live in that he should come down to the Student Council room. However, as&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt; Otonashi heads back to the Student Council room, a girl can be heard saying, &quot;There's a rumor that he's waiting for someone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So therefore, it's entirely possible that&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt; Otonashi is waiting for Kanade, and that this timestream somehow loops. Otonashi goes crazy waiting for Kanade, who has a infinitesimally small chance of reappearing in the Afterlife, but still, better than zero. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He turns himself into an NPC to be able to withstand the long wait, and creates the AI, or the &quot;AI&quot; to be able to maintain the requirements of the Afterlife, not allowing love to manifest, possibly therefore saving future arrivals from the pain that he has been exposed to. This may be why he creates &lt;a href=&quot;http://angelbeats.wikia.com/wiki/Angel_Player&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Angelplayer&lt;/a&gt;, because he knows that if Kanade reappears, then she'll know how to use it, any maybe program it to move him back from his NPC state. The members of the SSS arrive after this, then, at the time of Episode 1, the timestream loops, causing &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt; Otonashi to revert back from an NPC. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Forgetting everything that's happened to him, the events continue their course the same way they did before – &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt; causing the timeline to repeat over and over and over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;2.

His behavior throughout the anime is somewhat mysterious, as he constantly refers to himself as &quot;Christ&quot;, suggesting that he has some great power in the Afterlife World. He is the most logical choice because of his skill with computers, and his ability to interface with Angelplayer. However, he does require English translators to use the program.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;4. ???&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/eo6qN.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/eo6qN.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;You wouldn&amp;#39;t know, even if I told you.&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The AI tells &lt;a href=&quot;http://angelbeats.wikia.com/wiki/Yuri_Nakamura&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Yuri&lt;/a&gt; that the Programmer existed before the SSS appeared, and turned himself into an NPC. The AI also tells Yuri that she wouldn't know the Programmer even if the AI were to say it. This, logically, means that the Programmer cannot be a member of the SSS, Guild, or Kanade, as Yuri knows all of these people. Or, the AI could just have been made to respond that way to protect the Programmer.
