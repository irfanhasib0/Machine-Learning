Full contraction cannot be achieved. Myosin heads still bind to actin, but actin cannot slide wrt myosin filament, and only a local deformation is possible under this tension increment. But myosin heads don't stay bound for ever, and when one detaches, this tension increment is lost locally (there'll be heat produced, dissipating this energy), thus the global muscle tension doesn't increase further. This is a built-in limitation rather than a question of how much energy is available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6224" LastActivityDate="2016-05-17T20:37:44.430" CommentCount="0" />

Individuals who have a mother or a sister with anorexia nervosa are approximately twelve times more likely to develop anorexia and four times more likely to develop bulimia than other individuals without a family history of these disorders. Studies of twins have shown a higher rate of eating disorders when they are identical (compared to fraternal twins or other siblings).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hormone serotonin&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There has been found that anorexics have an overproduction of serotonin, which can cause a continual state of acute stress and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Researchers are still puzzled as to why, if anorexics already have high levels of serotonin, then SSRIs (medications like Prozac which raise serotonin levels) are successful treatments for some individuals. These scientists speculate that that there may be different subtypes of this disease, and that different groups of anorexics may have different neurochemical characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Researchers have also noted that abnormal eating behaviours and the resulting changes in the body can actually cause a disruption in serotonin levels, thus contributing to an already existing problem. Abnormalities in serotonin levels can lead to depression and anxiety. Studies also suggest that there are genetic predispositions to serotonin disruptions that appear to run in some families. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hormone dopamine&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Research suggests that women who develop anorexia nervosa may have altered levels of dopamine in their brains. Dopamine disturbances can cause hyperactivity, repetition of behaviour (such as food restriction), and anhedonia (a decreased sense of pleasure). This neurotransmitter also affects reward-motivated behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hormone cortisol/hydrocortisone&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Numerous other hormones in the brain have also been linked to eating disorders. Stress triggers the production and release of a hormone called cortisol; chronically elevated cortisol levels have been observed in patients with anorexia. Cortisol can inhibit appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hormone leptin&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Leptin is a protein hormone produced by the body's adipose tissue. Leptin is regarded as a hormone which can regulate fact storage and appetite. If individuals with anorexia nervosa lose extreme amounts of body fat, their levels of leptin drop which is known as hypoleptinaemia. The side effects of hypoleptinaemia can include amenorrhea, impaired metabolism, and bone loss.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, if people receive treatment, their leptin levels do not immediately return to normal. Initially during the treatment, leptin levels rise through the sky, which is also the reason why most patients are most susceptible of relapsing back into an eating order, since very high levels of leptin may cause a weight gain. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Sources:&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ENGEL, BRIDGET, NATALIE STAATS REISS, and MARK DOMBECK. &quot;Causes Of Eating Disorders - Biological Factors Continued.&quot; Mental Help Causes of Eating Disorders Biological Factors Continued Comments. 2 Feb. 2007&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3010958/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3010958/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apa.org/monitor/mar02/genetic.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.apa.org/monitor/mar02/genetic.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="19521" LastActivityDate="2016-05-18T06:49:49.247" CommentCount="0" />

When an allele is recessive it is only expressed at the phenotypic level when the individual carries two copies of the allele.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Following from your example, gene $A$ might be responsible for hair colour, with alleles $A_1$ and $A_2$ where $A_2$ is a recessive allele responsible for purple hair. I will denote the frequency of $A_1$ with $p$ and frequency $A_2$ with $q$. This means that the frequency of individuals with purple  hair ($f_{A_2A_2}$) is $q^2$ and the frequency of people with not-purple hair is $p^2 + 2pq$ (assuming an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealised_population&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;idealised population&lt;/a&gt;). As such, a population of 500 diploid individuals&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; where there is 100 copies of the $A_2$ allele would have the following &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pged.org/what-is-genotype-what-is-phenotype/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;genotypic (&amp;amp; phenotypic)&lt;/a&gt; frequencies:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$f_{A_1 A_1} = p^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$$ &#xA;$$f_{A_1 A_2} = 2pq = 2 \times 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.18$$&#xA;$$f_{A_2 A_2} = q^2 = 0.1^2 = 0.01$$ &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the allele for purple hair would be present in 19% of the population, but the trait would only manifest in 1% (only ~5.3%, $\frac{1}{19}$, of the people that carry the purple hair allele exhibit the trait). Therefore selection would be quite inefficient at removing this allele from the population, even if you could prevent all purple-haired individuals from reproducing. To find the frequency of $q$ required to give a genotypic/phenotypic frequency where 1 in $x$ individuals have purple hair just take the square root of $1/x$. E.g. to get 1 in 1000 individuals expressing purple hair &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$q = \sqrt{q^2} = \sqrt{(1/1000)}$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this mean for evolution?&lt;/strong&gt; Alleles that are recessive deleterious are very hard to remove from the population because, at low frequencies, they rarely produce the detrimental effect. Assuming complete dominance ($A_1 A_2$ = exactly like $A_1 A_1$), denoted by $h = 0$, &lt;a href=&quot;http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_18&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;selection&lt;/a&gt; only acts on $A_2 A_2$ homozygotes. The frequency of the $A_1$ allele increases at the rate $1/(1-sq)$ where $s$ is the relative fitness advantage. Mutation can also introduce more copies of the $A_2$ allele to the population such that there will be an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation%E2%80%93selection_balance&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;equilibrium, balanced&lt;/a&gt; by the rate of loss due to selection, and rate of gain by mutation. Furthermore, to further build on your analogy, a neighbouring population, where purple-hair is not selected against, may bring copies of the allele in by &lt;a href=&quot;http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_21&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;migration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suggested further reading on evolution &lt;a href=&quot;http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/home.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and reading on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;eugenics&lt;/a&gt; would likely be of interest to you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; 500 diploid individuals = 1000 gene copies.

A virus is the only thing that I can think of that fits the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could theoretically engineer an antiviral virus that is mostly non-pathogenic to other people, although this wouldn't be perfect. Even if it didn't code for specifically pathogenic proteins, it is a foreign molecule that is likely to raise an immune response, risks integrating into an important location in the host genome and would divert cellular energy to production of its proteins and away from other cellular processes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Say that you get this to work, that it's minimally harmful to its host and can effectively target the more pathogenic virus, against which you've designed it. What happens when the job is done? Is it still in the host body, pumping out more copies of itself and/or its antiviral proteins? If so, then it could end up causing more damage to the host in the long run, as it uses host resources to fill cells with no-longer-helpful foreign molecules. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given more thought or time (than I have), you could probably image more ways to tweak the design of this theoretical anti-virus, but as a brief answer, I think that the above considerations can give you a quick idea of what it would take to bring this system from the realm of science fiction to that of hard science. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="22033" LastActivityDate="2016-05-18T17:13:45.017" CommentCount="0" />

At each of these phases certain proteins have to be manufactured through mRNA and/or modified post-transcriptionally in order to serve an specific proliferative or anti-proliferative role, which overall eventually orchestrates the transit to the subsequent stage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Conventionally the cell cycle is comprised of 3 &quot;interphase&quot; stages prior to execution of Mitosis itself: G1 (growth, metabolically active), S (synthesis of DNA to duplicate genetic material in preparation for its splitting into two daughter cells), and G2 (gap phase where a numerous of quality control checks are undertaken in the form of surveillance of the newly produced DNA for example to ensure viability of the progenies).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Under these premises, the protein content of a cell at an specific phase is expected to cycle or oscillate in accordance with its requirements, and this is linked to mRNA cyclicity as the most direct responsible process for modulation of protein abundance. It is then related to the cell cycle in the sense that in order to transit from the G1 phase for instance, proteins involved in DNA synthesis will need to be produced, and thus protein factors released for the transcription of those certain mRNAs to take place. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Experimentally such dissection of cell cycle-regulated genes is tricky. Extracting mRNA from pure sub-populations of cells at specific stages of cell division is challenging as the isolation of such cell sub-populations is normally through chemical enrichments and sub-optimal synchronisation procedures. The signal to noise ratio is not ideal under these circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In brief, the cell cycles through stages in order to divide and such cycling is in itself due to the cycling of certain proteins, the most renown ones are called precisely &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26869/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cyclins&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, which are protein markers of cells division.

At least, is the first exception we study in genetics since sex linkage its so fundamental. These experiments established the chromosomal theory of inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Thomas Hunt Morgan, an embryologist who had turned to research in heredity, in 1907 began to extensively breed the common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. He hoped to discover large-scale mutations that would represent the emergence of new species. As it turned out, Morgan confirmed Mendelian laws of inheritance and the hypothesis that genes are located on chromosomes. He thereby inaugurated classical experimental genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;After breeding millions of Drosophila in his laboratory at Columbia University, in 1910 Morgan noticed one fruit fly with a distinctive characteristic: white eyes instead of red. He isolated this specimen and mated it to an ordinary red-eyed fly. Although the first generation of 1,237 offspring was all red-eyed but for three, white-eyed flies appeared in larger numbers in the second generation. Surprisingly, all white-eyed flies were male.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;These results were suggestive for hypotheses of which Morgan himself was skeptical. He was at the time critical of the Mendelian theory of inheritance, mistrusted aspects of chromosomal theory, and did not believe that Darwin's concept of natural selection could account for the emergence of new species. But Morgan's discoveries with white- and red-eyed flies led him to reconsider each of these hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In particular, Morgan began to entertain the possibility that association of eye color and sex in fruit flies had a physical and mechanistic basis in the chromosomes. The shape of one of Drosophila's four chromosome pairs was thought to be distinctive for sex determination. Males invariably possess the XY chromosome pair (Morgan used a more cumbersome notation) while flies with the XX chromosome are female. If the factor for eye color was located exclusively on the X chromosome, Morgan realized, Mendelian rules for inheritance of dominant and recessive traits could apply.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In brief, Morgan had discovered that eye color in Drosophila expressed a sex-linked trait. All first-generation offspring of a mutant white-eyed male and a normal red-eyed female would have red eyes because every chromosome pair would contain at least one copy of the X chromosome with the dominant trait. But half the females from this union would now possess a copy of the white-eyed male's recessive X chromosome. This chromosome would be transmitted, on average, to one-half of second-generation offspring—one-half of which would be male. Thus, second-generation offspring would include one-quarter with white eyes—and all of these would be male.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Intensive work led Morgan to discover more mutant traits—some two dozen between 1911 and 1914. With evidence drawn from cytology he was able to refine Mendelian laws and combine them with the theory—first suggested by Theodor Boveri and Walter Sutton—that the chromosomes carry hereditary information. In 1915, Morgan and his colleagues published The Mechanism of Mendelian Heredity. Its major tenets:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;• Discrete pairs of factors located on chromosomes like beads on a string bear hereditary information. These factors—Morgan would soon call them genes—segregate in germ cells and combine during reproduction, essentially as predicted by Mendelian laws. However:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;• Certain characteristics are sex-linked—that is, occur together because they arise on the same chromosome that determines gender. More generally:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;• Other characteristics are also sometimes associated because, as paired chromosomes separate during germ cell development, genes proximate to one another tend to remain together. But sometimes, as a mechanistic consequence of reproduction, this linkage between genes is broken, allowing for new combinations of traits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Morgan's experimental and theoretical work inaugurated research in genetics and promoted a revolution in biology. Evidence he adduced from embryology and cell theory pointed the way toward a synthesis of genetics with evolutionary theory. Morgan himself explored aspects of these developments in later work, including Evolution and Genetics published in 1925, and The Theory of the Gene in 1926. He received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1933.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;quoted from: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/resources/timeline/1910_Morgan.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/resources/timeline/1910_Morgan.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;see more: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esp.org/foundations/genetics/classical/thm-10a.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.esp.org/foundations/genetics/classical/thm-10a.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="19256" LastActivityDate="2016-05-20T17:25:20.727" CommentCount="0" />

Human eggs are kind of difficult to come by, so they developed a test based on the ability of a human patient's sperm to fertilize a hamster egg.  For that to work, they had to first remove the zona from the hamster egg, so sperm had direct access to the egg membrane.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This might not be freely available, but here is a link to an article:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/13/3/624.full.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/13/3/624.full.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is also a brief wikipedia page about this test.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="23999" LastActivityDate="2016-05-20T20:54:26.530" CommentCount="0" />

This presumably results in the intersex phenotype. Likewise, in the male, the absence of Dsx&lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt; prevents the expression of the genes for male sex differentiation, but does not repress those for female sex differentiation.

Because of the weak interaction, the blood flow causes the T-cell to move across the endothelial layer while still being attached to the endothelial layer. This is known as rolling. Other stimuli (usually chemokines) such as CCL21, CCL25, or ICAM 1 are needed to induce T-cell to migrate across the endothelial layer. This is important because these chemokines are expressed where there is inflammation. For example, there is a correlation between CCL25 level in the gut and inflammation in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;T-cells express α4β7 integrin or CCR7 that bind T-cell to the endothelial layer. Central memory T-cells and naive T-cells express CCR7 and CD62L and thus reside preferentially within the secondary lymphoid organs. Effector memory T-cells bind to gut endothelium with α4β7 integrin, CCR9, and LFA-1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CCL21 is expressed by both stromal cells of lymph node paracortex and endothelium of lymphatic vessels to assist migration of activated dendritic cells and naive and central memory T-cells to lymph node respectively. Dendritic cells are professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that migrate to lymph node where it can interact with T-cells more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T-cell activation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One important concept to take away from T-cell activation is that there needs to be direct contact between MHC complex and T-cell receptor (TCR).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;T-cells that have moved into the lymph node interact with dendritic cells, which have high MHC complex concentration on their cell surface. This leads to subsequent activation of the T-cell leading to release of cytokines such as IL-2 leading to proliferation of activated T-cells.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The activated T-cells now are able to freely move across the endothelial layer of non-lymphoid organs to infiltrate and look for infected sites. (Naive T-cells enter endothelial layer of non-lymphoid organs as well but this is chemokine independent nad thus not a reaction to inflammation).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Difference between naive T-cells and memory T-cells: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1782715/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1782715/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dendritic cell's role in immune response: &lt;a href=&quot;http://lab.rockefeller.edu/steinman/dendritic_intro/immuneResponse&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://lab.rockefeller.edu/steinman/dendritic_intro/immuneResponse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Memory vs naive T-cell migration:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/icb/journal/v86/n3/full/7100132a.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.nature.com/icb/journal/v86/n3/full/7100132a.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dendritic cell and role of CCL21:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3078419/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3078419/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Naive T-cell non-lymphoid organ infiltration: &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eji.200535539/full&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eji.200535539/full&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CCL25 and inflammation relation:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896841116300014&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896841116300014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="15558" LastEditorUserId="15558" LastEditDate="2016-05-23T20:31:05.080" LastActivityDate="2016-05-23T20:31:05.080" CommentCount="11" />

It just randomly diffuses (bounces around) in the cell until it sticks to something. The particular chemical structure (the shape) of the protein and whatever it hits will determine how tightly they stick together and whether or not a chemical reaction occurs. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A way to imagine this is to think of a jar filled with a lot of glass marbles (water), 1 marble shaped magnet (the protein), and 1 metal marble (the substrate). Put the magnet at the bottom, fill the jar most of the way full with glass marbles, and then put the metal marble on top. Then close the jar and shake it. Eventually, after colliding with a lot of glass marbles, the magnet and the metal marble will collide and stick to each other. That's how it works in cells also. In cells, the speed at which the molecules move is proportional to temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-8MP7g8XOE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here's a cool video&lt;/a&gt; that shows how proteins with a very specific shape bouncing around randomly can assemble into a complex structure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To get a sense of just how quickly molecules move in a cell, think of a bacterial cell.

In a cell of that size with no sub-cellular compartments, every molecule will collide with every other molecule in the cell about &lt;a href=&quot;http://book.bionumbers.org/how-many-reactions-do-enzymes-carry-out-each-second/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;once every second&lt;/a&gt; (if we make some assumptions such as no binding to other molecules). So if the cell contains just one unit of a certain enzyme, and just one molecule of its substrate, they will still collide fairly frequently (about once every second).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This rate decreases dramatically as radius of the cell increases. For example a cell with double the diameter (2 micrometers) has a volume eight times larger, so collisions between any two molecules take 8 times ($2^3$) as long to occur (in other words, it takes molecules 8 times longer to &quot;find&quot; each other).

This is consistent with at least one &lt;a href=&quot;http://thedea.org/hyponatremia.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, where someone died from drinking 7 liters of water in 1.5 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The mechanism by which water kills people is by lowering the amount of ions (chiefly sodium) in the blood. A condition called hyponatremia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coke contains four &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coca-colaproductfacts.com/en/coca-cola-products/coca-cola/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;relevant looking ingredients&lt;/a&gt;: Water, sugar, phosphoric acid, caffeine. Coke also has carbonic acid from the carbonation, but I'll assume we're either talking about uncarbonated Coke, or that the carbonation does not contribute to toxicity (perhaps a bad assumption).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before worrying about whether the water will kill you, let's verify that the caffeine and sugar won't kill you first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems unlikely that the caffeine in the coke would kill you before the hyponatremia. The concentration of caffeine in coke is about 0.1 mg/mL, and the LD50 is &gt; 150 mg/kg, so for the same 68 kg person, it would take about 100 L of coke to get a lethal dose of caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sugar in coke is more deadly, but still not as bad as pure water. There are about 0.11 g sugar per mL of coke. The LD50 of sucrose is &lt;a href=&quot;http://whs.rocklinusd.org/documents/Science/Lethal_Dose_Table.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;apparently&lt;/a&gt; around 30 g/kg. So it would take about 2 kg of sucrose to kill our 68 kg person. That is about 18.5 L of Coke.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The concentration of phosphoric acid in Coke is &lt;a href=&quot;http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ed060p420&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;about 5 mM&lt;/a&gt; which is about 0.5 mg/mL. The LD50 is about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9927393&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;1530 mg/kg&lt;/a&gt;. Which works out to about 212 L of Coke to kill by phosphoric acid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now that we've ruled out some other possibilities, lets get back to whether coke will kill you faster or slower via hyponatremia than pure water will.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Take another look at the the nutrition information for Coke. Notice that Coke actually contains some sodium, about 0.13 mg/mL in fact. A drink called &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.powerade.com.au/products/isotonic&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Powerade Isotonic&lt;/a&gt;&quot;  which claims to have a proper electrolyte balance contains sodium at 0.28 mg/mL.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So given that (A) what kills you first from drinking too much water is hyponatremia. (B) Coca-cola contains a non-trivial (but still less than many electrolyte drinks) amount of sodium. and (C) other potentially toxic components of Coca-Cola, such as acid and caffeine, require much higher doses to be toxic. &lt;strong&gt;It seems reasonable to conclude that Coca-Cola has a lower acute toxicity than distilled water&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Caveats:&#xA;I did not consider osmolarity. There could be some effect here that I'm overlooking.&#xA;I did not consider the effects of carbonation (soluble carbonic acid).&#xA;For people with certain medical conditions, such as diabetes or caffeine sensitivity, Coca-Cola may be toxic at much lower doses than for other people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="23650" LastActivityDate="2016-05-23T06:15:45.127" CommentCount="0" />

Another possible answer is top-down attention. This is where you actively/deliberately pay attention to something.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of mechanism, we have to think about different types of memory. For example, there are separate long-term and short-term memory systems (among many other distinctions). In general, there are hypothesized gating mechanisms that determine the information that can enter memory. The gating systems are controlled by some signal that says 'store this information' or 'ignore this information'. Different memory networks can have different gating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of work looking at neuromodulators as gating signals. Dopamine and acetylcholine are some prominent examples. For example, people have found that dopamine can modulate synaptic plasticity (the strengthening and weakening of connections between neurons, which is thought to be a primary mechanism of long term memory storage). It can also cause cortical remodeling. For just a couple examples, see:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Zhang et al. (2009) Gain in sensitivity and loss in temporal contrast&#xA;  of STDP by dopaminergic modulation at hippocampal synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Bao et al.

For example, if you stimulate the dopamine system, an animal may tend to repeat the behavior that led to the stimulation. A pathological version of this is thought to be what happens during addiction with certain classes of drugs that stimulate the dopamine system (e.g. cocaine, but not lsd).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, many of the same mechanisms appear to work across species, from sea slugs to humans).

I am a layman, so I might be ignorant to some already well-known or obvious concepts in biology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From what I understand, gene regulation can start from using histones to alter the compaction degree of the DNA, to posttranslational regulation. My question is, why? Why are there so degrees of control?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, from my textbook I read that Arabidopsis thaliana responds to low levels of Pi by upregulation of miRNAs that suppresses the E2 enzyme gene used to degrade Pi carriers, resulting in increase of Pi carriers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a situation like this, first of all, all of this seems to be a homeostasis to Pi starvation, and the response is to increase the amount of Pi carriers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why doesn't it just increase expression of carrier proteins? Why does it suppress the gene that codes for the E2 enzyme, instead? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why does the E2 enzyme even exist, in this case? Can't regulation of Pi carriers be done in transcription? Instead of just regulating Pi carriers via enzymes, why don't they just regulate the expression?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this way, if they needed more Pi carriers, they could just suppress/promote expression of the carriers, instead of having to rely on post translational methods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My second question is, I understand that transcription factors act as a switch, and the mRNA that gets cleaved into miRNAs and siRNAs, which act as post transcriptional gene regulation. What I don't understand is, why are there 2 methods? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, I understand that miRNA has more freedom in their targets since they are not 100% complementary to their target mRNAs, and siRNA can only target very specific mRNAs, so both have their advantage, but what are those advantages, exactly?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, would it be possible to calculate whether using miRNA for regulation is more effective than using siRNA for regulation?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="23898" LastEditorUserId="5144" LastEditDate="2016-05-24T10:43:25.260" LastActivityDate="2016-05-24T10:43:25.260" Title="Why are there so many regulatory mechanisms in gene expression?"

By removing pools and increasing sun exposture you will probably decrease habitats and larval survival. Continously managing grasslands usually also helps, since it removes excess plant materials and kills mosquitoe larvae by trampling (if grazing is used). To introduce grazing by e.g. sheep (if possible) will probably also have positive conservation effects. Stocking of fish might help, but I suspect that the mosquitoes mainly comes from adjacent waters and edge pools and not the main water body.

A genetic signature of selection is any pattern in the genetics of a population that can be used to infer past selection invent. These patterns include&#xA; - high population divergence around the specific site&#xA; - loss of heterozygosity (and polymorphism) around the selected site&#xA; - modification of the site-frequency spectrum&#xA; - genetic - environment covariance&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Further information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please note that the concept of heritability might have an unexpected definition for some layman.

The key here is to be aware that nothing is happening in isolation and the whole metabolism of the cell is one giant equilibrium. You make a change at one place that will result in proportional changes elsewhere to compensate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you start exercising, that is using ATP rapidsly, suddenly AMP spikes, the increase in [AMP] results in the upregulation of key enzymes in Glycolytic and TCA pathways, which causes and increase in ATP producting. How much is made? Whenever possible always just enough enough to meet the demand (assuming cell has resources to supply it and manufacture it).&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Absolutely, in the same way, the energy state of the cell, and the availability of Glc in and outside the cell (which it knows, because increase in blood Glc causes insulin to be release, muscle cell can bind to insulin, which results in activation of more GLUT4 to be expressed and expressed) directs how Glc is used, stored as glycogen, converted to FFA etc. When cell energy state is low, or exercising, signaling from muscle cells to liver (via lactate in blood/ Cori cycle) tell liver to release stored Glc into the blood.  l&#xA;If Glc in high in blood, insulin released from the pancreas, which tells the liver, to start sucking up Glc from the blood, and the way it does that is a lot better than muscle. Why? because of the binding properties of the different isozyme receptors expressed (same function but slightly different physical properties).&#xA;FFA metabolism is a same general concept, but different key enzyme players. The increase in metabolite availability causes or is a signal, which results in the appropriate response to balance level out the steady state dynamic equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The strategy is basically, if available in excess and can be stored it's stored until the limit of cell is reached, which is determined by the thermodynamic equilibrium of metabolite inside and outside the cell. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nelson, D.L.,Cox, M.M.(2013) Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry, 6th Ed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In response to your comment questions,&#xA;In general, like I mentioned, the strategy for coordinated fat uptake holds. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Majority of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake occurs in skeletal muscle, with about 10% of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake occurring in adipose tissue. However When it comes to FFA, these are largely delivered, absorbed and stored (as triglycerides) from bloodstream into adipose tissues. This process is definitely actively controlled and regulated, as you do not want fat globules floating around in your bloodstream. When energy state of the organism as whole is low, adipose tissue can sense and release FFA that can be take up by other cells (muscle, liver) and energy in molecules extracted during FFA catabolism pathways. How exactly adipocytes translate changes in glucose uptake or storage into signals that affect global energy balance is not completely understood it seems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a good place for much more detail, check out&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leto D., Saltiel A.R (2012) Muscle and adipose tissue in energy homeostasis, Nature reviews of Molecules Cell Biology, &lt;strong&gt;13&lt;/strong&gt;, 383-396 &#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/nrm/journal/v13/n6/box/nrm3351_BX1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.nature.com/nrm/journal/v13/n6/box/nrm3351_BX1.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="23258" LastEditorUserId="23258" LastEditDate="2016-05-25T19:02:33.460" LastActivityDate="2016-05-25T19:02:33.460" CommentCount="2" />

For example, as you would know a SNP is basically a feature of the DNA sequence. It is more of a genotype rather than a phenotype. Markers are supposed to be phenotypes (can be a molecular phenotype too for example a marker for stem cells etc). SNPs do create allelic variants but they may or may not contribute to different phenotypes. Consequently, the allelic variants may exhibit dominance or co-dominance with respect to each other. So, going by the definition used in classical genetics, you cannot call SNP as a &quot;dominant&quot;/&quot;co-dominant&quot; marker.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That is a weird usage of the terminology but people have done it so the deed cannot be undone. I would avoid future usage of such misleading terms. Having said that SNP would fit the definition of a &quot;co-dominant marker&quot; if it is observed by DNA sequencing . &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I would consider RFLP a technique and not a marker &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;. RFLP can be used to differentiate SNPs but sometimes it may not even resolve different strongly visible phenotypes (its efficacy basically depends on the polymorphism at restriction sites). Heterozygotes however, would have a different band pattern compared to homozygotes. So it should be a &quot;co-dominant&quot; marker.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AFLP, as far as I know is simply PCR amplification of restriction fragments. It would be &quot;co-dominant&quot; for the same reasons. However, just a PCR based screen would not differentiate between homozygotes and heterozygotes and would thus be a &quot;dominant&quot; marker. Now again, these are techniques and not, in a true sense, &quot;markers&quot; whereas SNPs and microsatellites are actual DNA features. So these cannot be even compared. A technique, depending on its resolution, can be &quot;dominant&quot; or &quot;co-dominant&quot; as per these definitions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For general interest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would want to reiterate that these definitions, for some reasons mentioned above, are quite flawed and are therefore misleading (hey may have been okay at certain point of time but are obsolete now).

However I’m not quite sure. And as I used to work in protein synthesis (but am a rather out of touch now) I decided to look at the recent literature a little to address some more esoteric or obscure questions it raised in my mind. I’ve set out the results below, and divided my answer into mature mRNA (which Sean covered primarily) but have also considered pre-mRNA. If the answer is not very useful to the questioner it may still be of interest to others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start and Stop Codons in Mature mRNA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The general picture of initiation and termination of protein biosynthesis &lt;em&gt;in eukaryotes&lt;/em&gt; (bacteria and archea are different) has been described by Sean and can be found in standard texts&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22421/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; cases the first AUG from the 5'-end of the mRNA is the one recognized as the ‘start’ signal for protein synthesis by the ribosomal-subunit initiation complex that scans along from the cap, according to the Kozak model&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC363659/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; and any one of the three termination codons encountered in the reading frame is recognized as ‘stop’ and (almost) invariably lead to termination of the polypeptide chain. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;START EXCEPTION 1&lt;br&gt;&#xA;As mentioned, in some 5% of mRNAs certain aspects of the environment of the first AUG from the 5'-end results in it being ignored by the complex, and the insertion of methionine and start protein synthesis occurs at the second (or perhaps even a subsequent) AUG.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC363659/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;START EXCEPTION 2&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Certain eukaryotic viruses were found to initiate the translation of the mRNAs internally, by a mechanism distinct from the 5'-scanning method. This involves an ‘internal ribosomal entry site’ — IRES. It subsequently transpired that a small subset of host mRNAs posses an IRES and can initiate translation internally. These include some growth factors, transcription factors and translation factors.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/15/13/1593.extract&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Such (rare) mRNAs can therefore have several AUGs in their 5'-untranslated region.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although it is possible to envisage an mRNA with several IRESs, and thus encoding several different proteins (analogous to a bacterial polycistronic mRNA), this does not appear to happen. It is striking, for example, that poliovirus RNA has just a single IRES for the start of the synthesis of single a large polyprotein, from which it generates multiple proteins by proteolysis. It would seem that the main purpose of this alternative initiation is to allow protein synthesis to proceed in the absence of a 5'-cap.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;STOP EXCEPTION 1&lt;br&gt;&#xA;There are some AGU codons that are recognized by a specific tRNA that inserts selenocysteine into the polypeptide chain. Some aspect of the environment of these codons causes them to be ignored by the protein termination system, and the ribosome continues translating, eventually terminating at a subsequent stop codon&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/87/12/4660.full.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;STOP EXCEPTION 2&lt;br&gt;&#xA;It has long been known that certain bacterial and eukaryotic viral mRNAs can increase their genetic repertoire by what is known as ‘read-through’ of ‘leaky’ stop codons. This is a ‘percentage’ effect, rather than all or nothing, and results in a mixture of ‘normal-length’ and extended products. It is now clear that the same phenomenon can occur in some eukaryotic mRNAs: quite frequently in &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://genome.cshlp.org/content/21/12/2096&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but also in mammals&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/42/14/8928&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;STOP CODONS &amp;amp; THE 3'-UTR&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I’m not clear what the questioner means by “is the stop codon always the final sequence before the poly-A tail?”. If the question is whether there can be additional stop codons in the 3'-UTR between the functional termination codon and the AATAAA polyadenylation signal (purple in Sean’s diagram) the answer is yes. Looking at the sequences of some muscle protein cDNAs done years ago, I found several stop codons in this region in each that I looked at. Of course they are without any function as the ribosome has already departed, but there is no reason for them not to be there on a random basis (and at apparently random positions).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start and Stop Codons in pre-mRNA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By &lt;em&gt;pre-mRNA&lt;/em&gt; I assume is meant the initial RNA transcript before splicing. There is no reason why an intron that is spliced out so that it does not appear in the final mRNA should not contain start or stop codons, which if not removed would have altered the reading frame. Many do. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A more interesting situation is where there is alternative splicing to produce different mRNA transcripts that encode different proteins. Pertinent to the question is the situation with start codons where the proteins differ in their &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;-termini, and stop codons where the proteins differ in their &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;-termini. The latter are quite common, but the former also occur, particularly were there are alternative forms of a protein, with and without a signal peptide&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/104/13/5495.full.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In these cases the start or stop codons will be present in both of two exons, one of which is spliced out in each case. Examples of this from a couple of &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; genes are illustrated:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/qFfpv.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/qFfpv.png&quot; alt=&quot;Changes in N- and C-termini by alternative splicing&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In both cases the coding regions are in orange, and the untranslated regions in grey.

Generally this is done at 12 or 24 volts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The current recommendations for a defibrillator requires 200v, and a very small amount of amperage.  This is one of three settings in a standard defib procedure.  The second setting is 300v, and the final is 360v.  The point of defibrillation is not to provide power to the heart, it is to disrupt the heart's built-in electrical (biological) circuitry, such that the heart can go to rest (not beating).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many cardiac events involve the heart beating in an uncoordinated manner, such that many or all of the muscle fibers in the heart beat in a manner that doesn't provide the squeezing action on the chambers to push the blood forwards.  Defibrillation seeks to correct such an uncoordinated beating by resetting the heart to rest, after which it will hopefully start beating again in a coordinated manner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, attaching a car battery is more likely to cook the heart (if it even gets that deep) because it is providing too much power, and it is unlikely to disrupt the heart's electrical field because it is too low of a voltage.

Basically it sits idle for long periods of time, and when it does require charging, it gets electricity from a wall socket, at higher voltage (and generally lower amperage).  This means it tends to charge more slowly, which in general means longer battery life.  Also the battery is built differently, to hold charge better at the expense of not being recharged as quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, a car battery is really the wrong tool for the job.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24096" LastActivityDate="2016-05-25T14:44:32.900" CommentCount="2" />

If you used a cheap home test, it's more likely analytic error (not necessarily your fault, it's just a hard thing to measure) than a real result. 4.0 pH is lower than most plants can tolerate--it's in the range of vinegar. Most plants (I have no experience with this species) prefer a slightly acidic soil, ~6.8pH. So, if your pH is really 4.0, then that's almost certainly a problem. It messes up the cation-exchange capacity of the soil, so even if you fertilize, the plant can't access the nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can easily amend with some lime--if you don't want to dig it up, you can just scratch it into the top of the soil, and water through it.

It's a classic case of ambiguous dual assignment. @AlexanderDScouras draws a reasonable conclusion that both is okay and to directly &lt;strong&gt;answer the question: dual assignment is possible, and allowed&lt;/strong&gt;. I would prefer to rule out beta sheets in this particular case, but on the condition that one highlights that there is plenty of hydrogen bonding in the hairpin loop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;So long as it's reasonable.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So long as you can reasonably justify the assignment it's probably okay. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pymolwiki.org/index.php/Dss#NOTES&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;You can manually assign any residue and secondary structure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# set residue 155 to be alpha-helical&#xA;alter 155/, ss='H'&#xA;&#xA;# update the scene in PyMOL to reflect the changes.&#xA;rebuild&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Evidence is always a good idea to support manual assignments. A quick and thorough way would be to run the sequence through a few secondary structure predictors, or use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://genesilico.pl/meta2/prediction&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;genesilico metaserver&lt;/a&gt; to save yourself some hassle (you'll need an account) (&lt;em&gt;this does feel like going back a step since you now have a structure, so exercise caution - if the sequence prediction doesn't look correct according to the structure, it's probably not&lt;/em&gt;).

The kits had fair results, but 5 passages post treatment mycoplasma were again detectable via Hoechst stain (PCR detection persisted through out).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The dox and enrofloxacin may have produced better results at higher concentrations, but cell toxicity became a serious issue.

There is no perfect correspondence between sequence and structure, but there is a statistical relation where presence of certain amino acids in particular sequences makes one conformation or the other more likely. For example, alanine, glutamate, leucine and methionine tends to be present in alpha helices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This topic has been studied for 50 years or so, and there are many methods available for predicting structural features from an amino acid sequence.

However, I might well forget something and one could argue that my semantic is less helpful some other semantic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Environment&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One issue related to make predictions at long time scale is that the environment changes through time in a way that we are not able to predict accurately enough yet.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Noise (incl. genetic drift)&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I am not here talking about measurement error or sampling error (these are concept of statistics you may want to check if you don't know them), I am talking about the stochastic process that are inherent to biological systems such as the randomness of mutation processes and genetic drift.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Genotype-phenotype map&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We have too little understanding of molecular genetics in order to be able to predict how different specific mutation would affect the phenotype. As a consequence, we today still have very little predictive power about the evolution of a phenotypic trait that is currently totally inexistent.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Complex systems&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For example: demography affects evolution which affects the social environments, which affects demography which affects pattern of species competitions which affects the evolution of another species which affects its demography which affects the evolution of a third species which affects the demography of our first species, etc... These kind of complex systems are often mathematically not tractable.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Parameters&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We often don't know the exact parameters of the lineage we are interested in. There is a lot of measures to take to be able to make predictions and we often don't have the money (or the time) to make all these measurements (assuming we are able to accurately measure them). For this reason, we are often relatively good to make predictions for a few model organisms but pretty bad for the vast majority of species.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applications of evolutionary biology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are not a lot of applications of evolutionary biology for the moment but still there are some proving its predictive power.

However I was unable to do the same to isolate the KanR plasmid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My next idea was to run the plasmids through a gel and do an extraction.

So I will describe each part of the voltage clamp graph.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The membrane can mainly be characterized as two components: resistor and capacitor. These two components would be connected in parallel with the ends of the parallel components having the same voltage as the outside and the outside of the membrane. You can see the effects of the two components in the graph you posted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sudden downward peak when the voltage is changed from -55 mV to lower voltage (let's look at -125 mV to see the maximal changes) is caused by step current of voltage clamp acting on capacitor part of the membrane. Characteristic of capacitors, there's initially a large current when the difference in the charge between the two sides of the membrane isn't large. The membrane charge difference quickly becomes large enough that the capacitive current disappears. BTW, the quick peak of current is negative because change in voltage is negative.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The gradual increase in membrane current (the part that looks like exponential decay) is caused by membrane ion channels opening. If this is a normal cell membrane, then I can't think of a channel that would show this type of behavior. It is definitely not sodium ion channel. With more negative voltage clamped between the membrane, more ion channels are opened and the current magnitude increases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After about a second, the voltage is clamped back up to -55 mV. The ion channels are still open so the current is still largely negative. The capacitive current that occurs is positive because of positive potential change. As you can see in the graph, there's a small positive peak. That is because the capacitive current was larger than the ion channel current in magnitude at that time point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After voltage is clamped to -55 mV, the ion channels deactivate and the current gradually decreases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope this helped.

Most bacteria have a cell wall (with either one or two membranes, see here for a detailed &lt;a href=&quot;http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/46738/most-bacteria-have-at-least-one-cell-wall&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt;), so drugs need to penetrate this barrier before reaching their target. Even if they do so, they must also preferably inhibit bacterial enzymes but leave human enzymes active. This is especially complicated for targets, like DNA replication, protein synthesis, etc. which evolved early in evolution and are common to bacteria and humans. Some antibacterial drugs target tiny differences between humans bacteria, for some like Gentamicin it works well, for others like Chloramphenicol the side effects are dose-limiting. Here is a good blog entry on this topic: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/11/18/antibiotics-not-as-easy-as-they-say&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Antibiotics not as easy as theysay&lt;/a&gt;, look at the blog for other excellent comments on drug discovery and antibiotics).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For something like a 70s ribosome in a pathogen, what is the process of being able to understand its structure, its shape, etc? How much effort does it take to model onto a computer? Or instead a single protein (as a 70s ribosome will be more complex), how long does it take to model a new protein?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To quote Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Prokaryotes have 70S ribosomes, each consisting of a small (30S) and a large (50S) subunit. [..] The large subunit is composed of a 5S RNA subunit (120 nucleotides), a 23S RNA subunit (2900 nucleotides) and 31 proteins.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To get a computer model of the structure for a single protein where a similar protein is known, it takes a few hours. But to validate this model, i.e. showing that the hypothetical structures matches the real structure, it takes months of human work. You can imagine how much work it is for 31 proteins. In addition tiny deviations in the model, may cause your predictions to give false positive or negative hits (i.e. your computer model predicts that inactive compounds bind to the target or real inhibitors don't do anything to the target).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The traditional approach, finding compounds which kill bacteria or inhibit their growth, is much more promising since one might discover novel targets in bacteria and microorganisms came up with dozens of ways of killing their competition. One new approach is to cultivate bacteria which cannot be cultivated with traditional methods and screen them for antibacterial compounds, e.g. as described in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/news/promising-antibiotic-discovered-in-microbial-dark-matter-1.16675&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt; of this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v517/n7535/full/nature14098.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;research article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some more good reads on this topic:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181823/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The role of serendipity in drug discovery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3109405/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A Brief History of the Antibiotic Era: Lessons Learned and Challenges for the Future&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="23616" LastEditorUserId="23616" LastEditDate="2016-06-04T10:42:13.410" LastActivityDate="2016-06-04T10:42:13.410" CommentCount="0" />

Look at this newly discovered albino cave isopod, for instance:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/0xgoI.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/0xgoI.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Iuiuniscus iuiuensis - Isopods are crustaceans that live in water or on land.

Why?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, members of &lt;em&gt;Myriapoda&lt;/em&gt; generally have simple eye structure, where as members of &lt;em&gt;Crustacea&lt;/em&gt; typically have compound eyes.  Trilobites have compound eyes!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now the other defining characteristic of crustaceans vs. myriapods, from what I've read, is the brain size.  But from what I understand little is known about the trilobite brain.  But I would argue the presence of compound eyes and the believed predatory niche suggests a more complex brain.  So that would make another somewhat hypothetical reason to pick &lt;em&gt;Crustacea&lt;/em&gt; over &lt;em&gt;Myriapoda&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was unable to identify any clear evidence in favor placing trilobites in &lt;em&gt;Myriapoda&lt;/em&gt; vs. &lt;em&gt;Crustacea&lt;/em&gt;..&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the overall defining morphological/physiological traits of &lt;em&gt;Crustacea&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Three body regions -- head, thorax, and abdomen (possibly fused).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Exoskeleton is typically hard and molted &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Each somite (body segment) can have a pair of appendages which &quot;vary widely&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Abdomen bears pleopods (swimming legs)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Appendages are often biramous.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Open circulatory system Straight digestive track&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Brain and kidney structures near the antenna&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Eggs hatch as larvae&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To my knowledge other than the internal organs (which are not well known) trilobites meet all of these criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then there's the visual test, as seen above, between living isopods and trilobite fossils.  They look obviously similar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to the chapter &quot;The Trilobite Body&quot; in Kaesler, R. L.'s, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=2BHDKX_QosoC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, Part O, Arthropoda 1, Trilobita, revised. Volume 1: Introduction, Order Agnostida, Order Redlichiida&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, each endopodite (walking leg) had 6 or 7 segments.

However, the origin of the &quot;diffusion&quot; can be very different than for, say, a bead in water.  The reason is that the thermal motion that creates the diffusion of a micron-sized bead can be much less important for a (large) cell.  For instance, the diffusion coefficient due to thermal forces of a sphere in a fluid with viscosity $\eta$ is &#xA;$$D_{therm} = \frac{k_B T}{6 \pi \eta R}$$&#xA;where $R$ is the cell radius (this is the &quot;Stokes-Einstein&quot; result).  For a white blood cell (say 10 microns in radius), this would - assuming blood is at least as viscous as water - lead to thermal diffusion coefficients around 1 microns$^2$/hour- i.e. we would need many many hours for a cell to travel its own diameter.  This result neglects a bunch of complexities - blood is not perfectly viscous, there is a really high density of red blood cells in blood, etc... but the basic result is that the thermal buffeting that drives the diffusion of a colloidal bead is not enough to drive a cell.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, cells are not passive beads!  They crawl, both randomly, and (as cancerconnector notes), in response to signals like chemical gradients.  If a cell crawls with a speed $v$ and maintains its orientation over a time $\tau$, it's reasonable to describe its motion (over times much longer than $\tau$ as being diffusive with an effective diffusion coefficient&#xA;$$D_{motility} = \frac{1}{2} v^2 \tau$$&#xA;which you can get mostly from dimensional analysis, or more rigorous models.  For white blood cells, $v$ is on the order of microns/minute - at least when measured on slides - it might be different in the body.  $\tau$ is a few minutes, so $D_{motility}$ is on the order of many microns$^2$/minute - orders of magnitude faster than mere thermal diffusion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A good introduction to modeling of this question is probably chapters 9-11 of Leah Edelstein Keshet's &quot;Mathematical Models in Biology&quot; and she cites some classic Lauffenberger papers on macrophage response, etc.  You may have access to this online: &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/1.9780898719147&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/1.9780898719147&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, note that everything I've said so far neglects blood flow - if this is important in your problem (which will depend on the context), things can get more complex (have to include flow in your diffusion equation).  But using diffusion equations to model the spread of randomly motile cells is a very common approach, and there is a lot of literature on it!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8780" LastActivityDate="2016-05-29T22:26:59.430" CommentCount="0" />

An example are successful actors influencing beauty ideals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the other part of our beauty ideals stemming from genetic compatibility, this overall explains different beauty ideals in different parts of the world (different average face&amp;amp;body, different role models, different genetic compatibility pattern).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To sum up averageness:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;(Weighted) averageness correlates with evolutionary advantages, therefore we evolved to find (weighted) averageness attractive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beware of circular logic:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Evolutionary pressure encourages sexual selection.

It's not likely to have a particularly dramatic effect on a short day facultative plant, other than to possibly delay flowering - it may mean the plant has to go through an extra period of darkness at nights for a longer time, in other words, the process of flower induction may need to start all over again. Or, as it was just one night, you might get away with it and they'll flower when you expected them to.

Crick was aware of the paucity of A at this position in anticodons, and both it and U are normally found in chemically  modified forms, the base-pairing of which he did not attempt to predict (he was unaware of most of them) and which is different in different cases. The point to remember is that there is a scientific rationale for this in terms of the three-dimensional structure of the anticodon in the tRNA (which holds the first two bases in position by base stacking) and the proximity of the potentially hydrogen-bonding groups in the various bases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Point (ii) is that Nature will only use Wobble where the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;genetic code&lt;/a&gt; allows.

It will only be more sensitive, more capable of finding matches. To understand this, you need to understand how the BLAST algorithm works, what the word size means. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you use a word size of $N$, BLAST starts by looking for a match of length $N$ between your query and target sequences. If such a match is found, BLAST then attempts to extend the match as far as possible. So, for example, consider these two sequences:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; query&#xA;CRKKL&#xA;&amp;gt; target&#xA;CRAKL&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, they are quite similar:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;query           CRKKL&#xA;target          CRAKL&#xA;                ** **&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, what happens if you try to find the target sequence with BLAST using the query sequence and a word size of 2 ($N=2$)? BLAST will take the first &#xA;$N$ characters of the query and try to match them against the target:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CR&#xA;CR&#xA;**&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It will then try to extend:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CRK&#xA;CRA&#xA;** &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It will find a gap and apply the gap penalty, but continue matching since the next characters match&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, thereby increasing the overall score of the alignment:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CRKK&#xA;CRAK&#xA;** *&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And so on and so forth. BLAST starts by matching the first $N$-sized word and then attempts to extend the alignment. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, what if we were using $N=3$?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CRK&#xA;CRA&#xA;** &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because the word size is now 3, we need at least three matching residues to match in order to attempt to extend the alignment. Since there is no 3-letter match, the target is missed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, decreasing the word size is better for finding small protein matches because it can use shorter matching sequences as an alignment seed. &#xA;As a general rule, playing with the word size is a question of finding the right balance between specificity and sensitivity. Decreasing the word size helps you find more matches (increases sensitivity) but it will also find more divergent sequences (decrease specificity). Increasing the word size will reduce the number of matches (decrease sensitivity) because you need a longer perfect match to start extending the alignment, but will increase specificity for the same reason. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you raise the word size to something close to the size of the query, you will only find almost exact matches. That might be what you want to do and it is what algorithms like BLAT which are designed to find near exact matches (for example, mapping a sequence to the genome it came from) do. Usually, however, we want less than perfect matches since we are looking for homologous sequences and not the exact same query.

The global &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iucnredlist.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;IUCN Red List&lt;/a&gt; (International Union for Conservation of Nature), which is arguably the most important tool for evaluating species' threats globally, is listing 1382 insects as threatened (categories: Near threatened, vulnerable, endangered, criticaly endangered and extinct) and this includes a wide variety of taxa. A large number of taxa have also been evaluated as 'data deficient', which means that they might be threatened, but we do not have enought information to say. Overall, global assessments have only been done for a small proportion of all insects. However, there are also regional (country) IUCN red lists which include a much larger range of taxa.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The knowledge level differs widely between countries though, which means that some countries have hardly evaluated any insects at all while others have relatively good information. In Sweden (which I'm most familiar with), we have a comparatively good overview of insects, probably due to a long tradition of natural history. For instance, species counts on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artdatabanken.se/en/the-red-list/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the Swedish Red List&lt;/a&gt; includes 196 Hymenoptera, 855 Coleoptera, 217 Diptera, 67 Hemiptera, 545 Lepidoptera, which represents 27%, 19%, 13%, 7% and 21% of all species found in these groups in Sweden. In Cerambycidae (Longhorn beetles), which I've worked with, about 45% of all species are currently red listed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally, the knowledge level on species trends over time or occurrence patterns is limited in insects though, which can make the evaluations difficult. The red list includes 5 main criteria, and indirect data (e.g. amount of broad habitat classes) are often used as proxies for species abundances or potential number of subpopulations. The process of actually determining a species as extinct is difficult though (not only for insects), since rare insects are often found very seldomly. Some &quot;naturally&quot; rare species might be found as singletons with several years between each occurrence, and the cut-off for considering a species as extinct can then be hard to define (a long period of no occurrences could just be a sampling issue).

The only way of knowing which number matches which symbol is to look it up in a book.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Popular presentations of the way cells work speak of the DNA/RNA code as a &lt;em&gt;code&lt;/em&gt;. There is no algorithmic transcription of RNA to proteins. The transcription from codons to amino acids is a code which human beings interpret by looking it up in a table. Cellular machinery interprets it by the fact that GUN→Val transfer RNA is present in the cell but a GUN→Glu transfer RNA is not. During protein synthesis, each transfer RNA molecule, having acquired a molecule of its designated amino acid, pairs with the codon it is designed to pair with. The code table is thus defined by the set of tRNAs that happen to be floating around in the cell.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(There may well have been some over-simplifications in the above picture).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the DNA code is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a code in the sense that the DNA molecule (and still more RNA) is not a passive repository of code sequences but a reactive entity, and those reactions depend on the nucleotide sequence in a way different from the tRNA-mediated encoding. Coding regions; non-coding regions; long strings of single nucleotides; initiation sites; 3-D structure of the molecule – all these depend on the nucleotide sequences in a way separate from their role as codons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is why this is a &quot;to what extent?&quot; question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A thought experiment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To the extent that the genetic code &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a code, an experiment of this kind ought to be possible, and perhaps even not far from practicability.

Manufacture a large quantity of these tRNAs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Taking the DNA of a target cell (not necessarily the same species as before), replace the genes coding for GAU-to-Asp and GAA-to-Glu tRNA with genes coding for GAU-to-Glu tRNA and GAA-to-Asp tRNA. Such a cell would not live, since it would mistranscribe most of its proteins.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Before reinserting the DNA, make a copy of it, replacing every occurrence of GAT with GAA and every occurrence of GAA with GAT.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Just before reinserting the DNA, flood the cell with the new tRNAs manufactured in step 2. &lt;em&gt;This changes the code.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Reinsert the DNA.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The cell should now be viable. Everywhere that GAT used to code for Asp in the original cell, GAA is now found; but since the only tRNA available to the synthesis process is GAA-to-Asp, this means that Asp is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; inserted exactly where it should be inserted. The change in DNA sequence is exactly compensated for by the change in available tRNAs - that is, the change in the code.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose of the thought experiment&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, postulate success.

This would include exposures you would predict cause both cell death and survival or growth and &quot;control&quot; exposures you know would kill or spare cells.

Clearly a DNA ATG maps to AUG in a particularly well defined way. mRNA AUG is also decoded to Met but the mechanism here is important: the tRNA is a &quot;decoding&quot; class of molecules, these have a complementary recognition site for an mRNA codon, e.g, UAC, and a binding site for an amino acid such as Met on the other end. These decoding molecules are otherwise identical in structures and interchangeable, indeed there are some bacterial species that use &quot;non-canonical&quot; decoding tRNAs different to other species and &quot;genetic re-coding&quot; where additional amino acids or frameshifts are encoded by our STOP codons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know if tRNA here fits your analogy as an algorithm or compiler but evolution has produced a vast range of exceptions we could test the genetic &quot;code&quot; on. Basically we work with a table that we're familiar with and some bacteria use a different one with additional amino acids like selenocysteine. Recent experiments have even added DNA/RNA bases not occurring in nature and &quot;non-canonical&quot; amino acids not used in naturally occurring cells, others are attempting synthetic biology to engineer their own cells as you've proposed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, it's worth noting gene expression isn't a simple one-to-one mapping. The amount and variant of gene expression is also important, many regulatory sequences affect expression of DNA, splicing of mRNA, or ribosomal binding. Once a protein is produced it is often cleaved, phosphorylated, or glycosylated and can form complexes with identical or different proteins. Whether the &quot;exon&quot; DNA encodes a &quot;raw&quot; protein sequence is intriguing and as much as I would hypothesise that DNA to protein is a true code, in the context of a complex biological system other factors beyond the raw sequence affect gene function. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24222" LastEditorUserId="24222" LastEditDate="2016-06-02T22:53:46.973" LastActivityDate="2016-06-02T22:53:46.973" CommentCount="0" />

It crosses cell membrane abd binds to its nuclear receptor.

As of now, there is no rational explanation as to why this happens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I guess all we can do is be grateful to the way our bodies have come into being.

Bacteria, fungi, animals like you and me and even plants can use fermentation in different occasions. Plant cells, like fungal cells (and unlike bacteria and animal cells) perform alcoholic fermentation. So, there is no need of a fungal contamination to make a plant tissue produce ethanol.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, of course, the presence of fermenting fungi, particularly yeasts, can make alcoholic fermentation much faster and noticeable. Several fruits contain what is called &quot;ambient yeasts&quot; (differing from &quot;cultured yeasts&quot;, which we add to the fruits latter) covering them, and I believe the most famous example are grapes. Grapes are covered by several genera of Ascomycota (like &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pichia&lt;/em&gt;), which can lead to alcoholic fermentation of the fruit. These species are different from &lt;em&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/em&gt;, the most common &quot;cultured yeast&quot; (and the one used in winemaking), but they can produce ethanol the same way. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This &quot;natural fermentation&quot; of grapes is known for a very long time, and it's probably one of the first cases of natural alcoholic fermentation known by civilized man.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PS: alcoholic fermentation in plant cells:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/149/2/1087.full&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/149/2/1087.full&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Under oxygen-limiting conditions, pyruvate can either be converted into ethanol by pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) or to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/100/1/1.full.pdf+html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/100/1/1.full.pdf+html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;During the early hours of germination [...] seeds rapidly generate high respiratory quotients and exhibit increased ADH2 activities and active alcoholic fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24284" LastEditorUserId="24284" LastEditDate="2016-06-04T09:28:20.127" LastActivityDate="2016-06-04T09:28:20.127" CommentCount="3" />

Different cells have to do different kinds of things and interact with each other, they form organized tissues and organs and so on. That much is obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For all of this to work in concert, cells have to grow and divide (to replace dying cells) in a nice orderly fashion/at a nice orderly pace. Since that's a complicated process, lots of the genes in any given cell play a role in managing how long that cell lives/how fast it divides (i.e., cell cycle regulation).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So now, if DNA in a given cell gets mutated, there's a chance that mutation will hit one or more of these genes that are involved in cell cycle regulation. And you can imagine there are two extremes of what might happen: On one extreme, the mutation could mess up the cell cycle in such a way that it's broken (the cell can't grow/divide, things get screwed up, and it dies off); on the other extreme, the mutation could instead destabilize the cell cycle in such a way that it's &quot;kicked into overdrive.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the first example, we wouldn't observe the effect; the mutated cell would just die off, no big deal. But in the second example, with the cell cycle in overdrive, that cell would barrel ahead, growing fast and dividing faster than the cells around it. And since each of its child cells would have the same DNA and thus have the same &quot;kicked into overdrive&quot; mutation, they'd divide too quickly as well, and so would their children…and eventually you'd have a crazy mass of out-of-control cells. That's a tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;p53 is a tumor suppressor because it effectively &quot;sounds the alarm&quot; when it notices DNA damage (mutation)—meaning, when it finds DNA damage, it initiates several processes to try and control/fix/stop it. This is important because if that DNA damage is like the second example above, it could lead to a cancer that harms or kills the whole organism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the p53 gene itself is mutated, then the cell has lost one of its major defenses against damaged DNA, and thus there's a much greater chance that a cancer-causing mutation in some other gene could go unchecked.

In reality, selection can act on groups regardless of the direction of selection at the individual level. This definition sounds to me (your link is directing me to somewhere unpleasant) like one that has been set up in order to study whether group selection can act as an explanatory principle for the evolution of individual-level altruism, which is an altogether different question than the title of your post (the two questions are often conflated for historical reasons).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To expand the debate, I will introduce two formal definitions of group selection both of which are defined by alternative forms of Price's equation (See Okasha's book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Evolution-Levels-Selection-Samir-Okasha/dp/0199556717&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evolution and the levels of selection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a thorough analysis). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interdemic group selection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interdemic selection occurs when selection acts on both groups and individuals within groups separately. That is, both groups and individuals within those groups must be units of selection in their own right. We must be able to assign fitness to both levels of selection some way, and track the offspring produced at each level. In this form of group selection, group fitness corresponds to the ability of a group to survive and produce more groups of a similar kind, and individual fitness corresponds to the ability of an individual &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; a group to survive and produce more individuals of a similar kind within that group. A good example  is selection on multicelullar organisms and selection on cells within those organisms. If there are greater than two levels of selection, interdemic selection is commonly referred to as multi-level selection 2 (MLS2) (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Evolution-Levels-Selection-Samir-Okasha/dp/0199556717&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Okasha&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;'The extinction of some groups and the ``reproduction'' of others are essential features of evolution by group selection. If groups are the units of selection, then they must have the properties of variation, multiplication, and heredity required if natural selection is to operate on them.'&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/stable/2823631&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Maynard Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intrademic group selection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Intrademic selection occurs strictly among individuals within a meta-population. That is, individuals are the only units of selection we study. The groups in which individuals reside are seen as part of the structure of the environment in which individuals live. In this form of group selection, individual fitness corresponds to the ability of an individual to survive and produce more individuals of a similar kind, &lt;em&gt;given&lt;/em&gt; that they reside in a particular group. A good example of this perspective on group selection is selection cells of the quasi-multicellular organism &lt;em&gt;Dictyostelium&lt;/em&gt;. Cells of this species are units of selection in their own right that occasionally group together into bodies that may also act as units of selection. If there are greater than two levels of selection, intrademic selection is commonly referred to as multi-level selection 1 (MLS1) (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Evolution-Levels-Selection-Samir-Okasha/dp/0199556717&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Okasha&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;'A way of looking at this is that the [intrademic] group selection approach looks at the evolution of individual characters in a group structured population, whereas the [interademic] group selection approach looks at the evolution of group characters.'&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2006.01258.x/full&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;West et al&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equivalence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is worth pointing out that there is currently equivocation in the field about whether these two selective processes are different perspectives on the same underlying biology or distinct causal processes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another important point to note is that it is the intrademic form of group selection that leads to the conclusion that kin selection and group selection are really just different perspectives on the same selective process. This has been shown mathematically by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/stable/2462497?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Queller&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is not yet a conclusive proof either way showing that interdemic group selection and kin selection are equivalent or not. Some evolutionary theorists feel that they are, while many feel that they are not. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group selection versus group adaptation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is also important to point out the distinction between the process of selection acting on groups (which most evolutionary theorists accept - I mean, it definitely does happen!), and whether or not this selection gives rise to group adaptations (which evolutionary theorists are equivocal about). Some argue that all adaptation can be explained from selection acting on lower-level units (right down to the gene, remember Dawkins?), whereas others think there may be nested levels of causality that cannot be reduced in this way. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empirical research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many examples of laboratory and field based studies of group selection.

The answer is yes: Each T-cell is specific for a single antigenic determinant. An antigenic determinant is a small portion of an antigen, such as a certain sequence of amino acids in a protein, that the immune system (a T-cell receptor in this case) recognizes as non-self or altered self. The antigenic determinant is also known as an epitope. Typically an antigen has many different epitopes, each able to react with a specific antibody or T-cell receptor (when presented with MHC).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The confusion arose from the description of the RNA as encoding &quot;mutant neo-antigens&quot; (among other possibilities, e.g., viral or endogenous self-antigens). At first glance this seemed to imply that a tumor antigen constituting a novel polypeptide antigen (&quot;mutant neo-antigen&quot;) was able to induce T-cell response (effector and memory T-cell responses) in the absence of any T-cells with a T-cell receptor specific to that neo-antigen. That would not be possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Through somatic gene rearrangement in development, T-cell receptors (TCR)  have a wide range of antigen specificity, such that each T-cell has a unique receptor on its surface able to recognize foreign protein antigen associated with MHC molecules. Some estimate that human TCR and antibodies can respond specifically to 10 million different antigens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apparently the distinction is made between classical tumor-associated antigens that typically constitute autoantigens (which may appear frequently on the surface of cancer cells in conjunction with MHC and therefore generate some antibody response, possible ineffective) and neo-epitopes, the latter being the result of the estimated 25 – 30% of antigenic mutations (mutations not normally found in the genome) in tumors that could be made to induce immune response on the single- or poly-epitopic level. It appears that autoantigens are more modified normal protein that tend to appear somewhere in the disease process on a particular class of tumor than the result of entirely novel mutations. Since tumors usually have tens to hundreds of non-synonymous mutations, the mutanome of a tumor provides many possible targets for custom poly-epitope vaccines for each individual patient. Coding messenger RNA (mRNA), i.e., synthesizing mRNA to encode multiple transcripts for synthetic poly-epitopic nucleotide sequences, is an attractive antigen delivery format. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to locate a sequence that would be likely to act in this capacity (that is, to select tumor mutations likely to exhibit immunogenecity), an approach like the following serial selection has been suggested: (1) next generation sequencing (NGS) of an patient's individual tumor mutanome and patient genome (2) identify triplicate sequences present in the tumor mutanome but not in the patient genome, i.e., identify the mutations in the tumor that distinguish it from normal self (3) identify those mutations that are likely to code for a protein (4) identify those mutations that are likely to cause a non-synonymous protein change (5) identify those mutations meeting all the previous criteria that a predicted to be in a peptide presented on tumor MHC. An example quantifying this selection process is that of the murine B16F10 melanoma mutanome: The NGS exome profile (coding exons) predicted 12,842 mutations; 3570 of those predicted as somatic mutations; non-synonymous mutations 962; mutated peptide predicted to bind MHC 462; 50 of those selected for testing and of those 50, about a third of those tested strongly immunogenic when encoded to RNA and transfected to dendritic cells, i.e., inducing strong T-cell response. As a test of actual anti-tumor effect, mice were immunised with the encoded mutations identified and achieved complete tumor protection and survival in 40% of the group, compared with death of all control group animals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generalizing, a poly-epitopic vaccine formed from a tumor mutation should be selected to be specific to the tumor and not in the patient germline genome, to occur in a protein-coding transcript, to cause a change in protein sequence and that protein be expressed in tumor cells. In order for the mutation to induce a robust T-cell response, the mutation-containing epitope must be presented on the patient's MHC molecules in the dendritic cells during vaccination (and at least one T-cell must possess a receptor specific for one of the epitopes) and in the tumor cells for recognition (on the surface of the tumor cells). With the patient HLA haplotypte, MHC-binding epitopes can be predicted with computer algorithms. The immunogenecity of the computationally predicted epitopes can be tested in vitro with T-cell stimulation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges to RNA delivery has been degradation by ubiquitous extracellular RNAses. The study noted [Systemic RNA delivery to dendritic cells] solves that issue by protecting the RNA with lipid carriers to form RNA-lipoplexes (RNA-LPX). This has the additional adjuvant effect (the RNA-LPX) of triggering interferon-a (IFNa) release by plasmacytoid DCs and macrophages in a manner similar to early phases of viral infection. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="22800" LastActivityDate="2016-06-04T22:51:11.833" CommentCount="0" />

One individual might be &lt;code&gt;ATTCTA&lt;/code&gt; while another might be &lt;code&gt;ATTCAA&lt;/code&gt; for example. These variants are called &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;allele&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. The whole goal of evolutionary genetics is to understand the creation (mutation) and change in frequency of the different alleles in the population.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heterozygosity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You probably know that in many species, we carry two copies of each chromosome. One individual can therefore carry twice the same allele at a given locus or can carry different alleles. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Expected heterozygosity ($H$)&lt;/a&gt; at a given locus is the fraction of the population that carries two different alleles at this single locus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When an allele reaches a freuqency of 1 (100%), that is only this allele exists in the population (and therefore the other alleles have been wiped out), we say that it has reach fixation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Natural Selection&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The process you describe in your first paragraph is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;natural selection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Natural selection is a fitness (=a function of both reproductive success and survival) difference between different genotypes. As you said (but with other words), deleterious alleles will decrease in frequency through time and will eventually end being weeded out from the population through natural selection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Genetic Drift&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are other evolutionary processes than natural selection. Typically, the one we will be interested in to address your question is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;genetic drift&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is genetic drift?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Genetic drift refers to the random sampling of a population in order to build up the next generation population. There are different ways to model genetic drift (Wright-Fisher model, Moran model, coalescence model) but without having to talk about the details of these mathematical models, it is important that you can conceive the role of random sampling in the change in allele frequency through time. For this, I invite you to first read &lt;a href=&quot;http://Why%20is%20the%20strength%20of%20genetic%20drift%20inversely%20proportional%20to%20the%20population%20size?&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why is the strength of genetic drift inversely proportional to the population size?&lt;/a&gt; and when you have finished come back to this post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One the below figure, you can see the effect of drift through time. The below graph consider a bi-allelic locus (a locus where 2 and only 2 different alleles exist in the population) starting with an initial frequency of 0.5 (=50%). Each line is a separate simulation and shows the frequency of only one of the two alleles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/owzS0.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/owzS0.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The above graph considered a population of size $N=100$ individuals. Below, the same types of simulation with a population size of $N=25$ individuals. As you can see that the genetic drift is stronger &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/hArHh.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/hArHh.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every single locus is subject to genetic drift whether it is under selection or not. However, if a locus is under strong selection, then genetic drift with have little power to explain what allele will get fixed in comparison to when the locus is neutral.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic drift and loss of alleles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is clear from the graph above that genetic drift also wipe variant out of the population. We just don't know for sure which variant will be wiped out. To be more accurate, the expected heterozygosity due to genetic drift is reduced by a factor $\frac{1}{2N}$ each generation. One can make plenty of calculations from basic models of genetic drift. For example the expected time to being wiped out is $\bar t(p_0)=-4N\left(\frac{p_0}{1-p_0}\right)\ln(p_0)$, where $p_0$ is the starting frequency of the allele of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A interesting result is that the probability of an allele to reach fixation is equal to its frequency. If there are $N$ individuals in the populations, there are $2N$ alleles (but not $2N$ different alleles). If there are, say 235 alleles &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; in the population and $2n - 235$ alleles &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; in the population, then over the long run (so that one will necessarily fix) the probability of fixation of the allele &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; is $\frac{235}{2N}$ and the probability of fixation of the allele &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; is $\frac{2N-235}{2N}=1-\frac{235}{2N}$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Wisdom teeth&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In your question, you are interested about a supposedly purely neutral locus. You talked about wisdom teeth I suspect more as an example rather than because you are interested to this trait.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's assume that the presence of wisdom teeth is completely neutral. Note by the way that as a rule of thumb if $2 N s &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 1$, (where $s$ is the selection coefficient on a given allele) then the allele will behave essentially as if it was a neutral allele. So, if wisdom teeth is neutral, then the probability of this trait to disappear over the long run depends on the frequency of the allele causing this trait. So far, I have assumed that we were interested in a single locus only. In reality, variation in many traits are caused by variation at several loci. In such case calculations are a little less straight forward (but still feasible). I do not know the genetic basis of wisdom teeth, so I cannot make good predictions for the evolution of this particular trait.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Other evolutionary processes&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few example of interest&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gene flow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note of course that there are other processes to consider when trying to predict the fate of a given allele or trait. For example, in a given population you might have a flux of migrants that come from a population where one allele is fixed therefore affecting the allele freuqency in the focal population. This is called Gene flow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hill-Robertson effects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Never forget that a locus is not alone on its chromosome. It is physically linked to other loci and selective pressures at other loci will affect the allele frequency at the focal locus. This is called Hill-Robertson effects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mutations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, when a locus is not polymorphic (has only one allele), mutations is the ultime source of variation. When a locus is polymorphic, then it is likely the mutations will have a minor effect on the allele frequency (although it depends on the size and type of locus and depends on whether mutations can make up new functional alleles).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pleiotropy and covariance between phenotypic traits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Phenotypic trait do not evolve independently. If wisdom teeth is a consequence of the activation of the molecular pathway for resistance to HIV (which it very probably is not), then wisdom teeth will not evolve as a neutral trait. A locus that affects several traits is said to have pleiotropic effects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4108" LastEditorUserId="4108" LastEditDate="2016-06-06T03:42:11.927" LastActivityDate="2016-06-06T03:42:11.927" CommentCount="0" />

It is calculated formally by summing the number of electrons donated to reach a full shell (H=1, C=4, N=-3, O=-2, P=5, S=6 etc.) divided by the number of a given element, but that is more confusing than anything.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Carbon can be oxidised four times, &lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; methane &gt; methanol &gt; formaldehyde &gt; formate &gt; carbon dioxide (not biological route, just an example), while oxygen can be reduced twice: to hydrogen peroxide and then to water. As proof, most O2 dependent enzymes produce hydrogen peroxide (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; FADH2 enzymes). That is a cheat way to work out where those numbers come from.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I would recommend forgetting about the formal calculations of oxidation numbers —in biology oxidation numbers of carbon are generally not discussed.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I will open the brief parenthesis of the oxidation states of carbon just to point out they are not those: -1 for a bond with hydrogen, +1 with oxygen and 0 for a C-C bond. Carbon monoxide therefore has an oxidation state of +4, while a C in glucose (on average) has a -1. Molecular oxygen has two identical atoms therefore is 0. Elemental carbon has 6 electrons so hypothetically you cannot strip carbon more than +6. &#xA;Here what is important is figuring out how many times a carbon in a molecule can be oxidised, that is how many electron pairs a molecule can give away as every time that happens an NAD+ (catabolism) or NADP+ (anabolism) is reduced, which is key to the cell. A dehydratase removes a hydroxyl group leaving an alkene, but it does not carry out a redox reaction: the geometry is no longer sp3, but sp2, and the oxidation state has decrease by 1 in that carbon, yet carbon kept its electrons —the other carbon increased by 1 as it deprotonated, so no net change and NADH is not generated.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Knowing how many electron pairs are given away going from glucose to carbon dioxide is important because cells cannot make them disappear and a terminal electron acceptor is needed either in the form of respiration or fermentation. There is a further concept, that of reduction potential. Different forms of terminal electron acceptors are employed in Nature: oxygen, Fe(III), sulfate etc. and these have different &quot;energy&quot; levels at which they accept the electrons (reduction potential, measured in volts), which translated to different amounts of energy that can be syphoned off during the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="19884" LastEditorUserId="19884" LastEditDate="2016-06-11T23:54:00.623" LastActivityDate="2016-06-11T23:54:00.623" CommentCount="2" />

That process leads to a making of &lt;em&gt;Action Potential&lt;/em&gt; which is an information that travels through neuron cells. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Excited material is crucial in this process. Because our brain deciphers the colors by studying which substance excitement lead to which action potential. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Example: If long-wavelength cones and medium-wavelength cones are stimulated, but medium slightly more. Then the receiving color will be mix of two, but slightly more towards shorter wavelength.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="21693" LastEditorUserId="21693" LastEditDate="2016-06-07T15:05:55.560" LastActivityDate="2016-06-07T15:05:55.560" CommentCount="3" />

Migration can both add and remove variation from populations, but is a within species mechanism of evolution (by definition there should be no genetic migration between species). &lt;strong&gt;Drift is the change in genetic variation that comes from random variation in reproductive success.&lt;/strong&gt; With drift there is no link between the genes and the rate of reproduction, i.e. carriers of one allele are equally likely to reproduce equally well as carriers of alternative alleles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Selection operates when there is covariance between reproduction (fitness) and the genes one carries, i.e. there is a tendency for the carriers of one allele to produce more offspring than the carriers of an alternative allele.

If you sweat, due to exercise or high temperatures, you lose about 1g/L of sodium. So right off the bat, all the research that's trying to find a population-wide correct amount of sodium to eat is on a wrong track, because there's no such thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;But it's even worse, because most of the research doesn't measure the amount of sodium people take in through food, it measures the amount of sodium they lose in urine. This isn't their intake, it's what's left after losses, so it's confounded by exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;And it's even worse than that, because while the actual studies indicate that there's no benefit from cutting salt intake, some high-status organizations once said there was, and are acting as though they can't take it back without losing face.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The overall result is that there are a bunch of people shouting &quot;less salt!&quot; and a bunch of people shouting &quot;the same amount of salt!&quot; and no one has any model of how much salt they actually need, so they occasionally end up deficient.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-06-06/the-reassuring-science-of-salt-consumption&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the article here claims&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;...there are the epidemiologists whose research appears to point in the other direction.

And here is the problem: as such, the &quot;colour&quot; is not a physical reality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some people may disagree here, but colour is not a physical property of any material. Light is a physical property. The wavelength, the energy, the frequency of light are physical properties. Even the crazy quantum nature of the photon with its restless existence is a physical property. But not colour. Colours are creations of my mind, my nervous system, my idiosyncratic consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, It's simply impossible to know if the red that I see in my mind is the same red that you see in your mind. The fact that we both call it &quot;red&quot; or the fact that we both agree that the colour of the blood is the same colour of the wine doesn't help at all: this is a problem of &lt;strong&gt;qualia&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And the same goes for all other conscious experiences derived from the exteroceptors, such as &quot;taste&quot; and &quot;sound&quot;. What I feel is particular and nothing can guarantee that another person feels the same, even if the stimuli are the same and the nervous impulse to the CNS are the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To finish, just an exercise for you to understand the subjective nature of the colour. We tend to imagine that the world is the way we see it (as primates, we value the vision very much). But we have only 3 different cones, giving us roughly 1 million (100$^3$) different colours. Reptiles, as the birds, have 4 different cones, and some of those reptiles, as pigeons, have 5, giving them the ability to &quot;see&quot; 10 billion colours (100$^5$). This is hypothetical, of course, to really perceive all these colours the animal needs a huge brain cortex, but let's suppose that they see all these colours. Now try to imagine these 10 billion colours, you, that only perceive 1 million. It's impossible. And it's impossible for a talking pigeon to explain to you how he/she sees the world, how are all these 10 billion colours, the same way that it's impossible for you to explain to an animal with achromatic vision what is green, purple, orange, cyan, magenta etc...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is what we call &lt;em&gt;qualia&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, as someone that loves cognitive ethology and science in general, I don't think that this is something beyond the realm of sciences, something impossible to know... this is a problem that can be addressed and, with the ingenuity of the neuroscientists and other biologists, we can someday understand the &quot;redness&quot; nature of the red we see.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24284" LastEditorUserId="24284" LastEditDate="2016-06-07T16:00:18.010" LastActivityDate="2016-06-07T16:00:18.010" CommentCount="0" />

In the case of Down Syndrome, that repetition in on a region of the 21st chromosome. Similar abnormalities in other chromosomes are possible, such as the abnormality which causes &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klinefelter_syndrome&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Klinefelter Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although animals do have chromosomes, they have different chromosomes than human beings do. For example, a horse has 32 chromosomes whereas a human has 23. Apes are most similar to humans, having 24 chromosomes. Therefore, if trisomy is to be found, apes would be most likely to have it. Researchers have attempted to answer this exact question and there is a paper on the subject entitled &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037811199500270G&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Conservation of the Down syndrome critical region in humans and great apes&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The result of this study was that the area on chromosome 21 in humans that is responsible for trisomy is found analogously on chromosome 22 in apes and that apes can, indeed, get Down Syndrome, if they have duplication of this region.

That's understood. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So firstly, the palisade layer consists of closely packed cylindrical/rectangular cells, while the spongy layer has loosely packed cells with many air pockets.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, these cells mentioned above are cylindrical/rectangular in the case of palisade layer, and cells in the spongy layer are rounder in shape.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, cells of the palisade layer contain more chloroplasts than the cells of the spongy mesophyll layer. A probable reason is that since the spongy layer is comparatively much further into the leaf, it doesn't get as much sunlight as the palisade, which is a lot closer to the surface. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, palisade layer helps in &lt;strong&gt;photosynthesis&lt;/strong&gt;, (in fact palisade cells are the site of photosynthesis) while the air pockets in the spongy layer allow &lt;strong&gt;exchange of gases&lt;/strong&gt; like CO2 required for photosynthesis. So there's a difference in function.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are also other differences, since the spongy layer contains other components like  vascular bundles, but I believe these are the major ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24250" LastActivityDate="2016-06-07T16:36:00.433" CommentCount="0" />

So, it is a rather humanly genetic problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the closer an animal is to humans, the greater the chance of it being at risk of suffering from down syndrome.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There have been several chimpanzees found with Down Syndrome. As the syndrome is caused by an extra copy of a specific chromosome (chromosome 21 in humans) only animals closely related to humans have a similar syndrome. Extra copies of other chromosomes cause even more serious syndrome and most are not compatible with life. To study Down syndrome, scientists have created mice that have extra copies of the same genes found on human chromosome 21. These mice have some of the features of Down Syndrome.$^1$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There had been some uproar a couple of years ago around a tiger (they have 19 chromosomes) who supposedly had down-syndrome.

This measurement is called the median lethal dose, and is often abbreviated as LD50.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In your table, they only provide the mass of the (average) dose of the substance needed to kill the organism listed, as can be seen by the (mg) after the words &quot;Toxic dose&quot;.

This is simply because the organisms need to live at least until their reproductive age to be able to reproduce. However, other than that I think there is no definitive correlation that animals normally live approximately eight times as long as their reproductive age (as your Elephant example seems to suggest). For example, many Insects such as the Mayfly only live until they reproduce and then die quickly (speaking of a &quot;magical first time&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To your supplementary questions: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) Similar to the above there is a general trend of larger body mass and longer lifespan. This is because a larger body requires longer to grow. Again, beyond this very basic correlation, I would be careful of trying to find rules there as you will find very different lifespans in animals of similar size. Take for example the mole (lifespan 6 years) and the naked mole-rat (31 years).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) No there is no general correlation between body size and metabolic rate. Metabolic rates vary greatly with habitat, warm blooded/cold blooded animals etc. If you restrict yourself to a certain family of species, such as mammals, you may find a weak correlation. For example, many smaller mammals have a higher metabolic rate, because their larger surface to volume rate requires a fast metabolism to keep their body temperature up. However also here you will find many exceptions (think of hibernation).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To summarize: It is tempting to try to find &quot;general rules&quot; in biology. However, while you will find many trends and correlations, particularly within certain families of species, calling them a rule is dangerous as it may lead people to believe they are generally true which is usually not the case because you will find exceptions everywhere.

On the other hand however, it has been proved that cannabis does acutely &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320597001951&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;increase cerebral blood flow&lt;/a&gt; (temporarily; in the right hemisphere) on the long run, exposure will cause an overall reduction in cerebral blood flow. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There have been studies with animals where they used an active cannabinol called delta-9-THC to demonstrate enhanced dopaminergic neurotransmission in brain regions which are usually associated and known to be implicated in psychosis. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In humans the delta-9-THC causes psychotic-like states and memory impairments. The effect of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CNS cannabinoid system&lt;/a&gt;, on humans is still tested by neuroimaging studies. &#xA;The endogenous cannabinoid system is sensitive to contact with exogenous cannabinoids such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15302527&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;delta-9-THC&lt;/a&gt;, which is known to impair memory in humans. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a further study is was examined what impact chronic cannabis use has on memory-related functions by examination of the subsequent memory effect (SME) of the event-related potential (ERP). The study concluded that comparing the group to the control group that chronic users of cannabis have an altered memory related brain activation in the form of dysfunctional SME production which may also go hand in hand with reduced neural efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Several investigators studied the acute effects of cannabis specifically on attentional processing. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11682259&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hart et al. (2001)&lt;/a&gt; studied the effects of placebo, light (1.8%), and heavy (3.9%) THC cigarettes in chronic, daily cannabis users and found no significant differences in the accuracy of response to attentional tasks. However, performance on a tracking task, which requires sustained attention, was found to improve significantly after the high dose of THC, relative to the other conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In one study of 37 adults with a history of light cannabis use, acute intoxication with a high dose of THC resulted in significant impairment on a measure of impulsivity &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12784123&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;(McDonald et al., 2003)&lt;/a&gt;.

At most, both are mildly diuretic (if any).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The assumption is based from an old study from 1928 with only three participants. While the small number of participants alone is a good reason to reject the study (it would never get published today) because the findings would lack any statistical power, the design is also questionable. You can find this story in reference 1 if you want to read it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is known that large amounts of caffeine indeed have a diuretic effect by increasing the blood flow to the kidneys and inhibiting the reabsorption of sodium. This leads to the outflow of water and an increased production of urine. See reference 2.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, reference 3 found that this diuretic effect (which is only present at high concentrations of caffeine) diminishes due to tolerance when people regulary drink tea or coffee. They do not see any diuretic effect from normal tea, coffee or caffeinated beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The explanation for this effect is most likely a misinterpretation of our observation. We seem to produce more urine when we drank tea or coffee, but we wrongly compare it to a time when we drunk nothing. If we would compare it with a time, when we drank the same amount of water, the effect (you have to pee more when you drank something) would be the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Drinking tea and coffee will therefore help to keep our waterbalance, as would water, juice or softdrinks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;References:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www4.zippyshare.com/v/gtxzzkyU/file.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;TOLERANCE AND CROSS-TOLERANCE IN THE HUMAN SUBJECT TO THE DIURETIC&#xA;EFFECT OF CAFFEINE, THEOBROMINE AND THEOPHYLLINE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www4.zippyshare.com/v/9snskGqu/file.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Caffeine and the Kidney: What Evidence Right Now?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www4.zippyshare.com/v/pZHUvmds/file.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Caffeine ingestion and fluid balance: a review.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5144" LastActivityDate="2016-06-08T16:11:08.887" CommentCount="0" />

However, you have to understand that the cellular interior i.e. the cytoplasm, is aqueous and therefore a monolayer vesicle like micelles would not work. In micelles, the two compartments - interior and exterior, have to be of opposite nature for the stability of the micelle. In other words, you cannot have an aqueous environment inside a regular micelle. Conversely, you cannot have a non-polar environment inside an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micelle#Inverse.2Freverse_micelles&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;inverse-micelle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since both the exterior and the interior of a cell are aqueous, both the membrane surfaces have to be hydrophilic.

On the other hand, SDS-PAGE &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; the protein to be drawn into linear structures so that they can pass through the gel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the manufacturer says that the antibody is monoclonal and can be used both for IHC and the blot (manufacturers do mention the compatibility of the antibody with different techniques and species), it is most probably derived against a linear peptide on the surface of the protein. This means that it would work for IHC (since it needs a surface epitope) or SDS-PAGE (which needs a linear one). &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;May you keep in mind that, a surface epitope can either be conformational or linear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Monoclonal Abs are produced by the hybridoma technique.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if the antibody is polyclonal, it is &lt;em&gt;much more likely&lt;/em&gt; that this set contains some IgGs that bind linear epitopes and some that bind surface epitopes.

Just as there is a “box” in certain enzymes for carrying hydrogen atoms around, there are special energy-carrying “boxes” which involve the triphosphate group. So, GTP has more energy than GDP and if the cycle is going one way, we are producing molecules which have extra energy and which can go drive some other cycle which requires energy, for example the contraction of muscle. The muscle will not contract unless there is GTP. We can take muscle fiber, put it in water, and add GTP, and the fibers contract, changing GTP to GDP if the right enzymes are present. So the real system is in the GDP-GTP transformation; in the dark the GTP which has been stored up during the day is used to run the whole cycle around the other way. An enzyme, you see, does not care in which direction the reaction goes, for if it did it would violate one of the laws of physics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, there are some mistakes here. For instance, GTP is not used in the muscle contraction but ATP. Perhaps this was not quite known during Feynman's times. Coming to the point, I think what Feynman means is that external work has to be done by the enzyme (that catalyses the GTP-GTP exchange) if it is actually moving the chemical equilibrium towards one side (against what would happen in an uncatalyzed condition). Some enzymes can actually do that (shift equilibria and catalyse one sided reactions), by using energy from ATP hydrolysis or other energetic transformations but since they are performing work by using energy from an external source, they are also not violating the second law.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's the essence of the second law of thermodynamics: you cannot move heat from a cold reservoir to a hot reservoir unless external work is done. We don't have &quot;heat&quot; here but there concept is the same for chemical energy and reaction rates. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3340" LastEditorUserId="3340" LastEditDate="2016-06-10T05:28:38.477" LastActivityDate="2016-06-10T05:28:38.477" CommentCount="0" />

For models of population dynamics, the rate at which the size of a population changes over time is normally accepted to be the net balance of four fundamental processes: &lt;strong&gt;Birth&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Immigration&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Death&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Emigration&lt;/strong&gt; ('&lt;strong&gt;BIDE&lt;/strong&gt;'; see for example &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_population_models&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Birth and immigration increase a population, death and emigration decrease it.

During G1 interphase (normal cell activity; not dividing), your chromosomes actually do not look like either of the pictures. They look more like a mass of noodles (called chromatin; look at the image provided below); it is only during prophase (step 1 of mitosis, where the cell undergoes division) that the chromosomes condense into the form you have depicted in picture 1. Now, in G1 interphase, you only have single chromosomes. You have 46 of these, which can be grouped into 23 pairs—23 from your father, and 23 from your mother. Remember they aren’t condensed during this stage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/bXacp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/bXacp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have also included a diagram of the cell cycle:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/SgVBC.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/SgVBC.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In S interphase, DNA undergoes replication, and each of the 46 chromosomes create a double. This double sticks to the original chromosome at a point called the centromere. So long as the two “chromosomes” are conjoined at the centromere, the two “chromosomes” are considered as &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; chromosome, consisting of two &lt;em&gt;sister chromatids&lt;/em&gt; (each like the “single chromosomes” you had previously). Again, in S interphase, chromosomes are not condensed, and look more like noodles than either one of your pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During prophase, the chromosomes look like picture 1. Picture 2 depicts a sister chromatid during prophase (and metaphase), which is considered a chromosome after anaphase (when the two sister chromatids are separated from their centromere). Remember that when the chromatids are not conjoined at the centromere, they are considered each as their own chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the human body always has 46 chromosomes. They are “double chromosomes,” as you call them, during S phase of interphase to the beginning of anaphase of mitosis. They are “single chromosomes” from anaphase of mitosis to the beginning of S phase of interphase. As most cells spend the most time in G1 interphase (normal activity), you can say that most of the time their chromosomes exist as single chromosomes. Again, note that most of the time they don’t look like your pictures, except for the times that I mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT: To answer the question in your comment:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If during interphase the DNA is not yet condensed and looks like a mass of noodles, then how can we know that there are 46 chromosomes (single ones in this case)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During interphase, it is indeed difficult to tell how many chromosomes there are. It is only when they condense that they become visible to the eye and can be observed through a microscope. Chromatin, in its noncondensed form, is considered as euchromatin—that is, &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; (noodly) chromatin. When it is condensed, it can be referred to as heterochromatin. We can only count the number of chromosomes when they are in heterochromatin form; euchromatin is invisible to us. If we align all the chromosomes present, we will get something called a karyotype. Look below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/karyotype_karyogram.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/karyotype_karyogram.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(You can see each chromosome in each of the 23 pairs are “double chromosomes.” These chromosomes were likely documented during prophase. Some karyotypes show &quot;single chromosomes,&quot; most likely taken during anaphase or early telophase.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In any case, double or single, we can observe that there are 46 chromosomes at all times. If we see &quot;double chromosomes,&quot; we would find 46 chromosomes. If we see “single chromosomes,” we would still find 46 chromosomes. In both cases, we would find 46 centromeres, and ergo, 46 chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;References&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reece, Jane A., Lisa A.

From personal laboratory experience, it is very difficult to raise a healthy, non-diabetic individual's blood glucose over about 6.5-7 mM (i.e. 120-130 mg/dl). My &lt;em&gt;best guess&lt;/em&gt; at where the highest glucose concentration might be in the body is &lt;strong&gt;within the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_system&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;hepatic portal vein&lt;/a&gt; that drains the intestines after a high carbohydrate meal&lt;/strong&gt;. The glucose concentration is probably highest in the prandial state or, in other words, when carbohydrates (i.e. food) is being digested and absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. Many simple and/or complex carbohydrates are digested to glucose and absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract. Once absorbed the glucose enters the venous mesenteric circulation and then drains into the hepatic portal circulation. This allows high concentrations of glucose and other compounds like amino acids from dietary nutrients to be &quot;buffered&quot; by the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't have hard evidence to demonstrate that this is the highest glucose, but I think it's probably a good guess. It is inherently difficult to measure the blood glucose concentration in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_vein&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;portal vein&lt;/a&gt; - mostly because it's so difficult to get to that place anatomically during a meal. The dog is probably the most used animal for these types of metabolic studies, because catheters can be placed in the peripheral venous and arterial circulation, as well as in the portal vein and hepatic veins, to measure nutrient uptake by the intestine and nutrient extraction by the liver. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A number of previous studies by Cherrington and colleagues, who have done some of the most comprehensive work in this field, frequently measure glucose flow rates across the liver. In one such paper that is &lt;strong&gt;freely available&lt;/strong&gt; from the &lt;strong&gt;American Journal of Physiology&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Abumrad et al&lt;/em&gt; in 1982 entitled, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7046460&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Absorption and disposition of a glucose load in the conscious dog&lt;/a&gt;&quot; you can see from &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt; the average plasma glucose concentration in the portal vein from a group of dogs given an oral glucose load of ~40 grams is somewhere in the 250 mg/dl region (i.e. ~14mM). These were otherwise healthy dogs, and similar to healthy humans I would be the glucose concentration doesn't rise too much further. As you could imagine though, in a diabetic individual who has high peripheral glucose concentrations to start, the portal vein concentration might be expected to be higher. How much higher is another educated guess - maybe 100-200 mg/dl higher on an extreme end (obviously pathologic).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a healthy human (i.e. non-diabetic) who undergoes a 75-gram &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webmd.com/diabetes/gestational-diabetes-guide/oral-glucose-tolerance-test&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;oral glucose tolerance test&lt;/a&gt; I can't imagine that the portal glucose would go any higher than 300-400 mg/dl (or, 16.5 to 18 mM).

That is, homologous chromosomes (one from your mother and one from your father) come together and bind together, forming a &lt;strong&gt;tetrad&lt;/strong&gt;. This binding is due to &lt;strong&gt;crossing over&lt;/strong&gt;, which is when the genetic material on the maternal chromosome and the paternal chromosome exchange places. The maternal chromosome gives some of its genes to the paternal chromosome, and the paternal chromosome gives some of its genes to the maternal chromosome. &lt;strong&gt;Crossing over increases genetic variety by creating a new chromosome with a new combination of genes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During metaphase I, the tetrads line up at the equator of the cell. During anaphase one, the tetrads are broken apart and each homologous chromosome that made each tetrad up is pulled toward one end of the cell. Look at the image below, where the blue represents paternal chromosomes and the red represents maternal chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/sHbXI.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/sHbXI.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent assortment&lt;/strong&gt; describes the phenomenon where the paternal and maternal chromosomes can be lined up randomly at the equator. There are many combinations. For example,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Both red chromosomes could face the top pole and both blue&#xA;chromosomes could face the bottom pole.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Both blue chromosomes could face the top pole and both red could face the bottom.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One red on the left and one blue on the right could face the top, as shown in the picture.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One blue on the left and one red on the right could face the top.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This random alignment at the equator makes it so that during anaphase, random proportions of maternal and paternal chromosomes get assorted into each of the resulting daughter cells. Some cells could get more maternal chromosomes and the other would get more paternal chromosomes, and vice versa. On the other hand, they could get similar amounts. &lt;strong&gt;Independent assortment increases genetic variation by allowing daughter cells to each &lt;em&gt;randomly&lt;/em&gt; receive a different proportion of paternal and maternal chromosomes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, crossing over and independent assortment (sometimes called random assortment) are different independent processes that both lead to an increase in genetic diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;References&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reece, Jane A., Lisa A.

As I understand the issue, the thought is not that genetics causes one to exhibit homosexual &lt;em&gt;behavior&lt;/em&gt;, precluding such behavior from being blameworthy (this would rely on determinism, in which case &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; otherwise freely willed behavior would be precluded in the same sense), but rather that genetics causes one to experience homosexual &lt;em&gt;attraction&lt;/em&gt;, to which an additional, philosophical premise (that it would be unfair to blame one for behavior influenced by homosexual attraction) is conjoined.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leaving the philosophy for a different day, what does the highest level scientific data have to offer this line of reasoning?  Have any large scale reviews of all available studies been performed, with as little bias as possible?  As a guideline for the types of questions that would be of interest:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it correct to say that the scientific research on the subject studies the correlation of genetics to homosexual attraction, rather than the correlation of genetics to homosexual behavior?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What strength of correlation does science as a whole show?  Does the state of a certain &quot;gay gene&quot; causally determine the subject to experience homosexual attraction?  Does it merely increase the probability that the subject will experience homosexual attraction?  Is there no consistent correlation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could any such correlations involve other causal links between genetics and attraction?  For example, is it possible that a purported &quot;gay gene&quot; is actually an &quot;experimental personality gene,&quot; or a &quot;tendency to rebel against societal norms&quot; gene, with the indirect effect of leading to homosexual attraction (I realize these examples are likely crude, not sufficiently nuanced)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24432" LastActivityDate="2016-06-11T21:37:39.480" Title="What does high level science actually say about the gay gene?"

Although mitochondria and plastids are thought to be derived from eubacteria — and their ribosomes have &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; similarities  in antibiotic sensitivity — the structures of their large rRNAs differ (as indeed do those of their small rRNAs and their ribosomal proteins). This is important because the large rRNA (the equivalent of 23S rRNA in &lt;em&gt;E.coli&lt;/em&gt;) is the target of many antibiotics, including the macrolide antibiotics, of which azithromycin is a member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiments &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; have shown that human mitochondrial ribosomes are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; sensitive to some of the macrolide antibiotics that inhibit eubacterial ribosomes, whereas those of some lower eukaryotes &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore it should not be particularly surprising that macrolide antibiotics do not affect human mitochondria, or that they do affect &lt;em&gt;Toxiplasma&lt;/em&gt; etc., the ribosomes in the apicoplasts of which are sensitive to these antibiotics &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; — presumably because of their rRNA structure in the specific target region.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An answer to the question in your title would seem to require an explanation of the molecular basis of these different sensitivities. It is thought (although not, I gather, definitely proved) that this is the identity of the base at the position equivalent to 2058 of &lt;em&gt;E.coli&lt;/em&gt; 23S rRNA: those ribosomes that are sensitive to the antibiotics have the base A in that position, whereas those that are resistant have the base G.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1083859/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Böttger, E.C. &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;(2001) EMBO Reports 21, pp. 318–323. &lt;em&gt;Structural basis for selectivity and toxicity of ribosomal antibiotics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v515/n7526/full/nature13895.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Greber, B.J. &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;(2014) Nature 515, pp. 283–286. &lt;em&gt;The complete structure of the large subunit of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="22057" LastActivityDate="2016-06-11T22:01:04.053" CommentCount="0" />

What are these chemicals? The answer to that depends very much on the tea.
