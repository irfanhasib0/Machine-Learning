However, you won't be able to drill holes (tempered glass &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; break of you drill a hole). Borosilicate glass has the advantage of being &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; heat-resistant, so it won't break from thermal expansion. If you go this route, you should pick up a few binder clips also to attach the sheet to the heated bed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Option #2- You might be able to get picture frame glass from a hardware store. It's super cheap (mine was $3 or something from lowes) and they'll often cut it to exact size. You might be able to drill this, but you have to be extremely careful. Sometimes, the hardware store can drill holes in the sheet for you if needed. If you don't want to drill, a few binder clips will work just as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just a note for if you are using binder clips: you might need to (depending on how your hbp is set up) get a piece of glass that is slightly smaller to allow for any bed leveling screws to have room. If you're going with the picture frame glass, you should make sure that the glass will be entirely within the heated part so that there isn't any heat gradient (that's how glass cracks/shatters). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="156" LastActivityDate="2016-02-03T01:55:24.110" CommentCount="0" />

If you, for instance, mount a fan lower than the tip of your nozzle, it will eventually collide with the printed object.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The effect of having unequally leveled nozzle tips for a dual extruder printer will be exactly the same: one of the nozzles will either drag against or collide with the model during print; or, one of the nozzles will be to far away from the model, giving poor layer adhesion.

Metal printing requires significantly higher temperatures than plastic, and the two processes are so incompatible that there is currently no good solutions that would allow one printer to print both in the same print. Whether extruding filament, laser sintering, or curing resins, the materials involved have to be fairly similar in processing environment to print adjacent to each other without issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many printers that are intended to print multiple materials by changing the print head.  You might, for instance, use a ceramic paste extruder, then change the head for the next print using plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There have been efforts in the past, and some efforts are ongoing, to resolve this.  For instance wood's metal, a low temperature alloy, can be poured at temperatures compatible with plastics, so it's possible to create a printer that prints plastic, leaving troughs or voids in the plastic, then the same printer during this print would pour molten woods metal into these areas, which then solidifies into an internal metal structure.  These are intended for circuitry and electrical use, however significant problems still exist because the thermal expansion differences in these materials lead to stress and result in poor reliability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So while some of these processes are being developed, this is still just in the experimental stage and there are significant problems to overcome before printers can print widely different materials in a single printing session.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course you can find plastics with such a wide range of characteristics that they can be seen as printing different materials.  Plastics imbued with wood fibers, printing next to conductive plastics with graphite, printing next to flexible plastics, etc, etc are now possible, and depending on your requirements they may meet your needs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="16" LastActivityDate="2016-02-03T14:16:22.343" CommentCount="2" />

If your bed isn't parallel to your X and Y axis movement, then you have to work very hard to make sure the heads are parallel to the bed, and with some mechanisms this isn't possible without making the mechanism itself parallel to the bed, so just mounting the new head at the same height as the other head might not be sufficient if your printer isn't perfectly calibrated already.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have not yet seen a printer or slicer that manages heads of different heights, but I suppose it's possible to manage the problem with additional intelligence.

Position one a bit higher than the other and what it prints won't stick to the bed very well, position one a bit lower and it will hit the bed and clog/be unable to print the first layer.&#xA;The only reason I can think of when you'd want one hotend to be higher is a situation when you're not using both hotends and don't want the second hotend to drag on and deform a layer the main hotend has printed and is still warm and deformable.

I think the quicker way is stopping the motors (in Repetier Host it's the &quot;Stop Motor&quot; button) and moving the gantry by hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tutorial: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED1Gxvw2Rmw&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED1Gxvw2Rmw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) Second one is just more advanced version of the above.

Well, since there is a lot of vibration during print those tend to get out of place and that might explain why you end up readjusting it over and over again. What I have found to solve this is to use a single drop of loctite (cyanocrylate glue) in the middle of the nut/screw. A single drop will secure it in place but also not make it impossible to unscrew in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) Setting up auto-bed leveling on your 3d printer if it's moddable enough.&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGFLwj0pnA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcGFLwj0pnA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you can't get the bed leveled no matter what, it might be uneven. That's usually caused by warping. Both PCB beds and alumnum beds can get warped. With the former just sandwitch a glass bed on top of it and it should be fine. Warped aluminum is pretty hard to flatten. In this extreme situation you might need to get a new aluminum sheet cut and drilled, preferrably a mm thicker one which is less likely to warp under the same conditions.

There are of course other factors which can result in clogging, but this can also affect it as even finer particles in less quality filament can get stuck now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4) Smallel nozzle disadvantage: since less plastic can come out at a given duration of time, it means less speedy printing of larger layer heights, if at all possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I feel like I should get back to (1) and explain why it is so.&#xA;When companies market their 3d printer they usually talk about the layer height (the Z resolution) completely ignoring the X and Y. This makes sense for marketing. Luckily it is not hard to explain what is usually left out and what is important for one of the answers to your question on what are advantages of smaller nozzles:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Z resolution depends on two main things:&#xA;1) The stepper motor driver accuracy of your 3d printer's motherboard. Pretty much all are the same now. Claiming your 3d printer can print at 20 micron layer height doesn't say anything, pretty much any 3d printed today can.&#xA;2) Nozzle/extruder quality, nozzle diameter. The latter surprisingly does not determine much. Because of how FFF/FMD 3d printing works, the perimeters of your 3d print can be way thinner than your nozzle diameter. This might sound odd but there's a simple explanation: the molten plastic coming out of the hotend is squished and stretched when the head moves. Because it is stretched, it can be made thinner as you increase how much it is squished. There's not much experimentation done on this and available online, only from personal experience I can say I can print perimeters 50% thinner than my 3mm nozzle. So I suppose if you wanted thinner perimeters than that, you would need to swap to a thinner nozzle.&#xA;Why would you want thinner perimeters? To get sharper corners or in other words better X and Y resolution for your 3d prints which is ignored by most unlike the overstated &quot;layer height&quot; (Z resolution).&#xA;Here's an illustration to help you visualize how fatter perimeters and less sharp corners/edges on your 3d model result in &quot;lower X/Y resolution&quot; (the illustration is a 2d cutout, viewed from the top):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/E9Q38.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/E9Q38.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="381" LastEditorUserId="381" LastEditDate="2016-02-06T02:18:17.257" LastActivityDate="2016-02-06T02:18:17.257" CommentCount="2" />

That causes poor layer bonding and weaker prints. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The flow of molten plastic coming out of the nozzle must be drawn down by tension in order to end up smaller than the nozzle opening, and that drawing effect makes it difficult to get good contact with the previous layer. So you end up with a &quot;stack of logs&quot; structure kind of like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/MwRXM.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/MwRXM.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;0.4mm wide by 0.4mm tall strands through a 0.4mm nozzle&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;(This photo actually shows layer height = extrusion width = nozzle size, which is another no-no, but the end result is similar.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What you want instead is something very &quot;mashed together&quot; and strong like this:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/zqaDx.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/zqaDx.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;0.4mm wide by 0.4mm tall strands through a 0.4mm nozzle&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How finely the the strand can draw down -- versus smearing or breaking apart into blobs -- will depend greatly on the type of filament and the printing conditions. For example, nylon draws down extremely well because it experiences a large degree of strain crystallization, and actually gets stronger and stiffer as it's stretched. PLA tends to get more brittle when strained and may break into stringy blobs. ABS doesn't change terribly much because it's highly amorphous. Polymer type, blending agents, print speed, printing temperature, and cooling will control the drawing behavior of the filament. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another factor to consider is what the strand spacing is within the print. If you set the extrusion width equal to half the nozzle width, depending on the slicer, adjacent strands may be placed with pitch equal or slightly less than half the nozzle width. So after the first strand is printed (say an unimportant inner perimeter) &lt;strong&gt;the &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; strand will be printed with the nozzle partially overlapping the previous strand.&lt;/strong&gt; This effectively creates a constriction to force the plastic out of a smaller opening to one side of the nozzle, which is not too different from printing with a smaller nozzle. Subsequent perimeter strands may then tend to &quot;heal up&quot; even if the first is low quality. This effect doesn't completely fix the problem, but it helps account for why under-width strands seem to work better than they ought to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, even if the strands turn out ok, it's arguable whether there is any benefit. If the goal of a smaller extrusion width is more precision and sharper corners, you may not actually accomplish that goal. When the filament is being drawn down by tension in the cooling polymer, it may tend to &quot;cut corners&quot; and get pulled into a rounded arc when the nozzle changes direction. That may defeat the point of using a thinner extrusion width in the first place. Generally I only recommend using under-width strands to capture thin-wall detail that is only a little bit too thin for the nozzle, not as a way to improve overall print quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, having the extrusion width equal or wider than the nozzle ensures the plastic is firmly squished downward into intimate contact with the lower layer. You can fudge this a bit and still get decent results, but it's &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; best to keep the extrusion width equal or larger than the nozzle size. There's no hard cutoff where it will / won't work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="298" LastActivityDate="2016-02-06T06:19:08.443" CommentCount="5" />

That explains why you use the Arduino IDE to update or modify their firmware.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now why you would want to use an Arduino + an Arduino shield board like RAMPS? Well if you're not good at electronics, are happy with the cost of your own board, don't care much about upgrades/modding beyond what is possible with your board, maybe you shouldn't, it might be overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are several advantages with using Arduino with a shield for your 3d printer, &quot;two boards are not just the predecessors of the one board solution&quot;, no.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) It is moddable/exandable/upgradable/has replacable parts.&#xA;If your printer came with its own motherboard that doesn't have additional or enough pins to add more fans, enclosure lights, a second extruder, an LCD and you want to, it sucks. RAMPS can do that, it has plenty of extra pins.&#xA;It is upgradable. You want to replace the stepper drivers with a new one? Or you accidentally damaged the one you have? Fear not, you can just replace that instead of the whole motherboard.&#xA;Think if it like other motherboards being PCs on which you can't change the CPU, RAM and GPU.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) It is here for a long time, you will be able to acquire one for a long time.&#xA;There isn't just one company making RAMPS or similar sheilds. Sometimes 3d printing companies go out of business or stop producing your particular motherboard. RAMPS is likely here to stay. Because Arduino is very likely here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) As said above, not just one company owns or makes RAMPS or other Arduino shields. Besides the possibility of your motherboard not being produced anymore, there's also the advantage of not being at the mercy of one companies pricing and shipping policies. This is true for some other boards as well though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4) It is possibly cheaper than what have you. I don't want to post a link, but one company right now is selling their derivative of Printrboard for like $180. Check the cost of Arduino Mega, stepper drivers and a RAMPS board yourself, quite a difference. That said, there are some boards which are close in price.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;5) It's an Arduino. Why is this a good thing by itself? Because many people who have a 3d printer are tinkerers/makers and they already use Arduino for other projects. It is open source with a rich library to control many things. The modding and upgrades for your 3d printer which can be done with Arduino is another level higher. Or it can be a good learning experience for your future Arduino projects. If on the other hand you already use Arduino and are experienced with it, you might use it just because you know how to control it/fix it better than some specialized board you haven't seen before. Plus for a guy like you your 3d printer's motherboard will be an &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; part, that's nice, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Video on RAMPS: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYJn6FuWOv4&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYJn6FuWOv4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="381" LastEditorUserId="381" LastEditDate="2016-02-06T23:58:49.873" LastActivityDate="2016-02-06T23:58:49.873" CommentCount="0" />

On the other hand, there's no disadvantage to using modular electronics either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, another advantage of modular electronics is that you can upgrade separate components (for instance, swap in better stepper drivers).

Bridging is when you are printing between two solid pieces (like a bridge). Overhangs occur when printing off of a single solid piece and coming back. Most slicing engines allow extra settings for speed, fan power, etc for these parameters, just refer to this terminology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A very common and simple solution in getting features to 3D print properly is to just slow down! If you're not a in a rush to get the part done, you bring down all of the feedrates in your slicing engine. MakerWare has mine at 90/150 mm/s for print and rapid. Typically I'll bring that down to about 50/90. My reasoning is the more time you give the plastic to cool, both while and after printing the layer, the more rigid that layer will be for the next one. When briding or overhanging, there will typically be a sagged area in the print. You can minimize this by providing the plastic more time to cool. Also keep in mind that printing on supports is still technically bridging (printing between two solid pieces).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thing to keep in mind is adhesion from one layer to the next matter just as much between the current layer and the previous as the current strand to the one next to it. So, in some cases, increasing your shell could possibly make it easier for the infill/roof/floor strands.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="98" LastActivityDate="2016-02-07T17:30:29.193" CommentCount="2" />
