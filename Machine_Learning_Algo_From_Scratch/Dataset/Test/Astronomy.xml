The goldilocks zone is usually defined in terms of a region where the equilibrium temperature of the planet lies between some temperature limits (these temperature limits are somewhat debatable, but irrelevant for the purposes of this question - the boundary becomes fuzzy). This region can be calculated by working out how much flux is received from the star at a given radius.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In that sense - all stars have a goldilocks zone - you can always work out some distance from a star where the flux is roughly equivalent to the flux we receive from the Sun for instance. It is much closer to a dim star and much further away from a luminous star.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But&lt;/strong&gt;, there is a difference between a habitable zone and a &lt;em&gt;continuously&lt;/em&gt; habitable zone. If you seriously want life to evolve on a planet, then it will take time. How much time? No-one is sure but it seems to have taken a few hundred million years in our solar system. There are also good reasons to suppose that young planets are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to be habitable - either they are still extremely hot after formation or they are being bombard by debris.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus you can probably exclude any star with a main sequence lifetime of less than about 100 million years (or longer if you feel conservative about how long it takes life to get going). This rules out stars of more than about 5 solar masses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might also rule out stars that evolve quickly. If a star changes its luminosity quickly on a short timescale then the habitable zone moves drastically too. This will happen near the ends of the lives of all main sequence stars and for all subgiant and giant stars. So for these, yes there is an instantaneous habitable zone, but no region is in a habitable zone for hundreds of millions of years or more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might want to consider not only the luminosity of the star, but its spectrum as well. For instance, both hot white dwarfs and low-mass M-dwarfs are reasonably stable and long-lived; they are faint, so have habitable zones close to the star (much closer than 1 au). However, for different reasons, both these types of object emit copious UV radiation. In hot white dwarfs it would be because they have hot photospheres. In M-dwarfs they can be highly magnetically active into old age, having a hot chromosphere and corona that would strongly irradiate any nearby planet. You might consider that their &quot;habitable zones&quot; were in fact uninhabitable. Of course an atmosphere and a strong magnetic field might counteract this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lot of this depends on your terms of reference and definition. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstellar_habitable_zone&quot;&gt;wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; on habitable zones has quite a nice discussion, which emphasizes the debatable nature of this topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A final thought, which is not in the wiki page. Multiplicity could mess things up. Planetary systems will not be stable in the habitable zone of either star in a binary system if their separation is comparable with the orbital radius of the habitable zone. If you had two stars like the Sun, their separations would have to be less than a few tenths of an au or greater than of order 10 au in order to allow something to orbit at about 1 au around one of them. Even then, there could be all sorts of dynamical instabilities which prevent long-lived planets, especially if there were other planets in the system too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2531" LastActivityDate="2015-03-04T09:21:01.917" CommentCount="1" />

It also has its own luminosity (predominantly in the infrared).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A quick calculation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The solar constant (flux at 1 au) is about 1370 W/m$^{2}$. Jupiter is situated about 5.2 au from the Sun (it varies by about +/- 5%) and has a radius of 70,000 km. The albedo is about 0.34.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus it receives about $7.8\times 10^{17}$ W from the Sun and radiates about $2.6\times 10^{17}$ W back into space. Assuming this is done more-or-less isotropically into a hemmisphere, then Ganymede, at a distance of 1,070,000 km from Jupiter, receives a flux of only 0.1 W/m$^2$ multiplied by the fraction of the sunlit hemisphere that can be seen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This compares with the $\sim 50$ W/m$^2$ it receives from the Sun!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;surprising result&lt;/strong&gt; (to me) puts into perspective all the simulations you see of things in orbit around Jupiter.

A protostar is hidden by the gas cloud that surrounds it. Protostars aren't visible. At some point in their evolution (and where this occurs depends on mass and metallicity), a protostar will start clearing the surrounding cloud of gas. This process happens very quickly from an astronomical point of view. (Aside: From a human point of view, this is anything but quickly.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case of very massive stars, the newly emerged star is already on the main sequence. Very massive stars are &quot;stars&quot; (objects with a stable mass, stable size, and fusing hydrogen into helium) well before astronomers can see them. In contrast, very small stars spend hundreds of millions of years of evolution between being a &quot;star&quot; (visible to astronomers) and being on the main sequence. The star is a pre-main sequence star during this long span of time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Intermediate mass stars also spend some time as a pre-main sequence star. How much time depends on mass and metallicity. In the case of a star with a mass of ~1 solar mass and metallicity comparable to that of the Sun, the time spent as a pre-main sequence star is on the order of tens of millions of years. In contrast, the time spent as a protostar is very short, tens of thousands of years. The time taken to clear the star system of gas (the transition from protostar to PMS star) is shorter yet, hundreds to a few thousand of years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no point at which one can say fusion starts. It's a probabilistic thing, with probability increasing sharply with density and temperature. What about objects at the low end of density and temperature?

The smallest red dwarfs are quite cool. They fuse hydrogen into helium via the &lt;em&gt;p-p&lt;/em&gt; chain, but rather infrequently. The largest brown dwarfs also fuse hydrogen into helium via the &lt;em&gt;p-p&lt;/em&gt; chain, but here the fusion reactions are so very infrequent that the brown dwarf gets cooler and cooler.

And since the Sun is expected to grow and increase it luminance, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_the_Earth#Loss_of_oceans&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Earth might be unhihabitable for any life somewhere between 1 or 3 billion years in the future&lt;/a&gt;. So, a planet that have longer time to develop before its parent star moves it beyond the inner edge of the habitable zone is more favorable than Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since Earth itself always was inside the habitable zone since it formed 4.6 billion years ago and will still be for lets say more 1.4 billion years, with a large uncertanity factor, this gives roughly 6 billion years of time for complex life to develop. Given that it is unlikely to form early due to the time needed for evolution to take place and due to an elevated level of large bollides collisions, we could discount the first 2 billion years from any life bearing planet, including Earth, as unlikely to develop complex life. Further, it is unlikely that complex life would finally evolve out from simpler forms when the planet is already overheated and already crossing the inner edge of the habitability zone, so lets take out the finishing 10% of that period for any planet (probably something more than 10%, but lets keep this as a conservative estimative). So, for Earth, this gives a window of a size of 3.4 billions years to complex life evolve. Similar planets with larger windows have better probabilities. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stars larger and more luminous than the Sun tends to be more unstable and live shorter. As a result, it is expected that planets around stars larger than the Sun has less time to develop complex life, and thus a shorter time-window. On the other hand, this means that stars smaller and less luminous than the Sun gives a larger time-window to the planets to develop life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For stars smaller than the Sun (a G-type yellow star), we could consider the K-types (aka, orange dwarf) and the M-types (aka, red dwarf) as specially favorable.&#xA;An orange dwarf star &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-type_main-sequence_star&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;may live for 10 to 30 billions years in the main sequence&lt;/a&gt;.

Lets assume that this is really bad, so a planet orbiting an orange dwarf in the habitable zone is likely to have a better habitability than Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Accordingly to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v312/n1/box/scientificamerican0115-32_BX1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, a planet with two times the mass of the Earth, will have stronger gravity, and thus it is likely to be flatter. Further, it is likely to have a ticker atmosphere that would protect the surface from UV radiation better than Earth. It would be geologically active for a longer time, resulting in more carbon cycling. With the right quantity of water (not a desert nor a global very deep ocean), it might be an archipelago world, since its flatness would not allow the ocean to be very deep nor the continents to be very large. As a result, life would flourish in a number of rich biologically favourable environments significantly larger than Earth. Further it magnetic field is likely to be stronger than Earth's one, protecting the surface from cosmic rays.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a result, a planet with two Earth masses orbiting an orange dwarf star in the habitable zone has a good chance to be more habitable to life than Earth itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, near-circular orbits are more favourable than excentric ones, since excentric orbits may make the planet enter in periods of freezing or boiling.

Even though this star's total mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, this star will never go supernova. This star will instead live for billions of year on the main sequence, then a bit longer as a post-main sequence star, and finally end it's life as a white dwarf with considerably less mass than that original 1.6 solar masses (and considerably less than Chandrasekhar limit).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The star leaves the main sequence when it burns all of the hydrogen in its core. Two things happen at this point. One is that it starts burning hydrogen in a shell around an inert core of helium. The other is that it expands into a red giant. (Note: Some people are taught that a star becomes a red giant when it starts burning helium. This is not the case. This post-main sequence star is a red giant that is not yet burning helium.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That inert core of helium increases in mass as hydrogen shell burning proceeds. A funny thing begins to happen with this increase in mass: The inert core becomes degenerate. An even funnier thing happens next: Adding even more mass makes the degenerate core shrink in size. The star is poised on the next phase of its evolution, which is helium burning. The formerly inert, degenerate core of helium is no longer inert or degenerate at this stage. Think of this phase of a star's life as a main sequence helium burning star. It's definitely not on the main sequence, but much of the physics is the same. One thing that is different: The shell burning of hydrogen is still occurring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This phase doesn't last long. The star will soon consume all of the helium in its core. At this point, the star becomes a red giant for a second time. This is the asymptotic red giant branch. The star has an inert core of carbon and oxygen surrounded by a shell of fusing helium, which in turn is surrounded by a shell of fusing hydrogen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These end of life convulsions are not good for the stuff that surrounds the shell of fusing hydrogen. The star expels a lot of that gas into nearby space. Eventually it will expel most of the burning shells of hydrogen and helium, leaving an inert, degenerate core of mostly carbon and oxygen. This is a white dwarf. A planetary nebula of expelled gases surrounds the white dwarf. The white dwarf itself has but a fraction of the star's initial mass. Most of the mass is in that planetary nebula.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Larger stars are even more proficient at expelling mass than was this 1.6 solar mass star. For stars with an initial mass of about eight solar masses or less, the white dwarfs left behind at the end of the stars' lives will be less than the Chandrasekhar limit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fate of stars over ten solar masses is much more violent. At the end of their lives, they have lurking inside them a series of burning shells that surround an inert, degenerate core of iron. A star has about five days to live once that core of iron starts forming. That's about how long it takes to create (from scratch) a degenerate iron core that approaches the Chandrasekhar limit. At or near the limit, the core starts to collapse, and the star forms a type II supernova.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A white dwarf can form a type Ia supernova with a little help from a binary neighbor from which the white dwarf is stealing mass. Conditions have to be just right for this to happen, but when it does, the white dwarf can gradually accumulate mass and go supernova. Since white dwarfs have expelled all of their hydrogen, there won't be any signatures of hydrogen in the supernova explosion. In fact, it's the lack or presence of hydrogen in the supernova signature that distinguishes type I from type II supernova.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2618" LastActivityDate="2015-03-08T21:14:51.547" CommentCount="0" />

But on the other hand, Dr. Hamilton describes a flow of spacetime between the event horizon and the inner horizon, and he says it is plausible that within that area, space itself (which has no substance, in his words) can be described as flowing in and being flung back out. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't understand how space can have these two opposing properties - (1) a curvature that is maintained in order for the black hole to exist, that is, a curvature generated because matter can interact with the space and (2) a flow of space that sounds like it is not subject to a restriction of crossing back out of the event horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's that apparent difference between (1) and (2) that I want to understand better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6739" LastEditorUserId="6739" LastEditDate="2015-03-11T15:54:43.357" LastActivityDate="2015-03-11T17:25:46.413" Title="Looking for help in understanding how black holes can move" Tags="&lt;black-hole&gt;&lt;cosmology&gt;&lt;general-relativity&gt;" AnswerCount="2" CommentCount="0" FavoriteCount="1" />

Thus in particular, the mass and energy density is identically zero everywhere in spacetime. Because of some technical issues, this does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; imply that black holes have no energy or mass; rather, it means that we can't directly think of them as an integral of mass or energy density. See also &lt;a href=&quot;https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/6589/do-black-holes-have-energy&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;I also saw Dr. Andrew Hamilton in another documentary state that within the event horizon of a black hole (again paraphrasing), space is falling toward the singularity so fast that it effectively drags everything with it (including light).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For an isolated black hole in a particular frame field, this is a valid picture. For example, the Schwarzschild spacetime in Gullstrand–Painlevé coordinates can be interpreted as Euclidean space falling into the black hole. However, the spacetime is itself is stationary (even static) in the geometrical sense—there is a timelike field representing a direction in which spacetime geometry is left unchanged (this corresponds to Schwarzschild time, in fact). Similarly, rotating black hole spacetimes are stationary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But generally speaking, you really can't think of black holes as some sort of suck-holes for space. It's just an analogy that applies to simple situations (isolated black holes, with nothing else in spacetime) and then only in a particular frame or coordinates. That's not to say it's useless--e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_metric&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;acoustic horizons&lt;/a&gt; in fluids are interesting analogies to event horizon--but don't take it too literally.

If you really want to tie everything together, then interpret Dr. Thorne's comment about stuff falling into the singularity as crushed out of existence as also applying to space. It doesn't come out of any &quot;other end&quot;. It stops existing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But really, that's past the point where the fluid analogy make sense anyway. I think Dr. Hamilton might note that the full maximally-extended Schwarzschild spacetime is a black hole, so one may be able to think as it &quot;coming out&quot; of the corresponding white hole, but he &lt;a href=&quot;http://jila.colorado.edu/~ajsh/insidebh/waterfall.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;would also tell you&lt;/a&gt; that this white hole is a mathematical artifact that doesn't have anything to do with actual astrophysical black holes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;But I want to understand why it is that space itself can cross the event horizon when other things can't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course they can. In the infalling-fluid analogy, they're carried along by the space that's being sucked in. Perhaps you're thinking of the fact that it takes an infinite Schwarzschild time for an object to reach the event horizon. But that doesn't imply that things can't cross the horizon; rather, it's just a symptom of Schwarzschild coordinate chart not covering the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Intuitively, think of a coordinate chart as a &quot;grid&quot; drawn on a patch of spacetime. That patch may be the entire spacetime, or it might be just a piece of it. In the case of the usual Schwarzschild coordinates, it's just a piece... one that simply doesn't cover the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Regarding the last part, I meant space crossing the event horizon the other way - out of the sphere demarcating the event horizon - whereas material objects go one way - in but not out, spacetime itself does not seem so restricted, at least not in the sense of &quot;pinning&quot; a black hole to one part of itself. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OK, your edited question provides some more context. But the answer is completely the same: what Dr. Hamilton is talking about in the video is the maximal analytic extensions of the rotating black hole solution, which does contain a passage into a completely different region (sometimes called different 'universe'). This is very much analogous to the maximally extended Schwarzschild spacetime, which contains a wormhole that comes back out of a white hole in another spacetime region, except that the extension of the rotating Kerr black hole spacetime contains an infinite chain of such connected regions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I haven't watched the entire video, but it's clear that's what they're talking about when they say &quot;in a ship propelled by pure mathematics&quot;, because the causal structure of such spacetimes is well-known. Once again, I direct your attention to Dr. Hamilton's own page, linked above, that explains that this dual waterfall picture is an artifact of mathematical idealization and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; something that actually happens in reality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, even if you take the maximal analytic extension of such black hole spacetimes overly seriously, it's important to emphasize that you don't come back out into the same region, but rather a different one connected by a wormhole inside the horizon. If you're up to it, I also recommend Dr. Hamilton's &lt;a href=&quot;http://jila.colorado.edu/~ajsh/insidebh/penrose.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;conformal diagrams&lt;/a&gt; of said black hole spacetimes, which make it quite clear that's what going on is a whole &quot;chain&quot; of black holes and white holes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="661" LastEditorUserId="661" LastEditDate="2015-03-11T17:25:46.413" LastActivityDate="2015-03-11T17:25:46.413" CommentCount="1" />

The reason is that in typical interstellar environments, densities are so immensely low that even for just two atoms to meet, the probability is so small that formation time scales are very long. For 3+ atoms, the chance decreases rapidly. Instead, an atom can stick to a dust grain and wait for ages until other atoms stick. The atoms slowly &quot;crawl&quot; around on the surface of the dust grain, eventually meet and make bonds. If the formation of a bond releases energy (is exothermic), the molecule can be ejected from the grain surface. This process is call &lt;em&gt;adsorption&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The dust also helps shielding the molecules from stellar radiation which would otherwise easily destroy them.

This is probably also how the dust itself is formed, although it might also be formed later on (this is currently debated; the problem is that supernovae are so powerful that their shock waves tend to destroy dust shortly after it forms, and planetary nebulae are created from stars that live so long that they can't explain the abundance of dust in the very early Universe where they wouldn't have had the time to live their lives).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As Stan Liou and LocalFluff says, methane is actually an &quot;easy&quot; molecule to form, both because it's rather simple, and because its constituents, hydrogen and carbon, are the most and the fourth most abundant elements in the interstellar medium, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, far more complex molecules are regularly found in interstellar space, as can be seen on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_interstellar_and_circumstellar_molecules#Ten_or_more_atoms_.2815.29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5264" LastEditorUserId="5264" LastEditDate="2015-03-11T20:32:25.890" LastActivityDate="2015-03-11T20:32:25.890" CommentCount="0" />

In models this happens if they are more massive than about 13 times Jupiter. The weakness of this that we think isolated brown dwarfs could condense from a gas cloud that are less massive than this; and young brown dwarfs won't have got around to fusing deuterium.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Planets must form from the disk around a star.

It is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; they could all have formed around stars and then subsequently been ejected, but the presence of significant numbers of these objects in young star forming regions and the &lt;em&gt;lack&lt;/em&gt; of $\sim$10 Jupiter-mass objects orbiting stars, suggests that there is an alternative formation scenario that can produce such objects in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What could these formation scenarios be?

Direct imaging of earth-like planets at 1 au from the host star is utterly impossible with &lt;em&gt;current technology&lt;/em&gt; - the problem is not the sensitivity, it is the contrast achievable at small angular separations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first demands high precision photometry (a transit by an &quot;earth&quot; across a &quot;sun&quot; produces a lightcurve dip of about 0.01%). This kind of precision &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; been achieved (by space-based observatories), but they have not observed stars for sufficiently long to build up the requisite number of transits (you need &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; a few) to confirm a detection at periods of 365 days The Kepler primary mission ceased after about 4 years, meaning it will be tricky to dredge out convincing Earth-like transit signals at periods of 1 year (but not impossible) -  and even then you need to perform some sort of follow up to prove it is a planetary mass object, rather than some false positive, and actually estimate the mass to show that it is a rocky planet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the doppler radial velocity technique. The motion of the Earth-Sun system results in the Sun executing a 1-year orbit around the common centre-of-mass, with an amplitude of about 9 cm/s.

They don't somehow suffer from any problems that universes with dark energy don't have. In fact, they're better because you don't have to somehow explain dark energy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/10117/does-dark-matter-really-exist/10120#comment13269_10120&quot;&gt;Rob Jeffries&lt;/a&gt;, here's one tidbit about the one fairly important role of dark energy in the Big Bang:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our universe is close to flat (see the many papers by the WMAP team), and quite a lot of measurements have confirmed that we're not living on some wacky-shaped universe. The issue is that the measurements indicate that the universe isn't &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; flat. Again, see the WMAP data. You can attribute part of the percentage offset from flatness to experimental error, or you can attribute it to the idea that perhaps the universe isn't so flat after all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dark energy provides an explanation for this inherent not-quite-flat-ness that characterizes our universe. In those other toy universes (without dark matter), you need to explain this near-flatness some other way. Not in our universe, it seems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Dark matter and dark energy aren't just theories.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, sort of. Coming from someone like me (who is firmly on the &quot;theorist&quot; side of the scientific spectrum), that's quite a whopper. But from a certain point of view, it's completely accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dark matter is actually a theory. It's an explanation for some screwed-up galactic rotation curves, where some stars near the outer edges of a galaxy move much faster than they should.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/M33_rotation_curve_HI.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/M33_rotation_curve_HI.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So it's actually a theory to explain a phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dark energy, on the other hand, is an experimental phenomenon. We don't have a good theory to explain it. But it's a phenomenon responsible for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy#Evidence_of_existence&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;many different problems&lt;/a&gt;. There's quite a lot of evidence that says, &quot;Something odd is going on.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I mean by all this is that there's a heck of a lot of evidence for them. Our theories of them were created to explain evidence, and not vice versa (evidence gathered to support or refute a theory).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I advise, once again, that you look at the Wikipedia articles on both concepts to start learning more (especially the sections on evidence).

It turns out that this is not far enough away that the object would have eluded detection in all-sky surveys. The recent WISE survey in the near-infrared should have been capable of detecting even a very cool brown dwarf (and indeed it has detected some very cool brown dwarfs, just not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; close to the Sun - e.g. a 250K brown dwarf only 6 light years away &lt;a href=&quot;http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...786L..18L&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Luhman et al. 2014&lt;/a&gt;) that was close enough to the Sun to be a Nemesis candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the details do not appear to be on the wikipedia page, I'll fill some in. If we take a very low mass brown dwarf - say 20 Jupiter masses - in a 26 million year orbit, then Kepler's 3rd law tells us this will be about 90,000 au (1.4 light years) from the Sun (assuming a circular orbit). According to the evolutionary models of &lt;a href=&quot;http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...689.1327S&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Saumon &amp;amp; Marley (2008)&lt;/a&gt;, such an object has an intrinsic luminosity of $10^{-7}$ times (1 ten millionth) that of the Sun and a temperature of 400 Kelvin and would appear to have a spectral type of late T or early Y. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the calibration of absolute magnitudes versus spectral type for cool brown dwarfs in &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.6977&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Marsh et al. (2013)&lt;/a&gt; we know that at 90,000 au, such a brown dwarf would have magnitudes of $H=14$ and $W2=8$. The former is bright enough to have been seen in the 2MASS all-sky survey and the latter is easily detected by WISE. The combination of data would also easily have revealed the large parallax of such an object. We can conclude that an object would have to have &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; lower mass than this to remain undetected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now the middle part of your question: The star will &quot;wobble&quot; in response to its companion with exactly the same period as the orbit. So, if you are prepared to wait for an appreciable fraction of 26 million years, then yes, the presence of the binary companion might be revealed! Otherwise not. Measuring the &quot;wobble&quot; by doppler methods is currently capable of detecting Jupiter-mass objects in orbital periods of 10-20 years. Measuring the wobble &quot;astrometrically&quot;  - that is measuring the position displacement of the star due to an unseen companion is more sensitive to distant companions, but still, one is limited by the fact that the wobble period will be the same as the orbital period of the companion. An assessment of the performance of the Gaia astrometry satellite by &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1173&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Perryman et al. (2014)&lt;/a&gt; suggests detection of planets with orbital periods out to 10 years might be possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the final part of the question - yes, the motion/wobble of a star can be decomposed (using Fourier techniques) into components that are due to each planet. There are numerous examples of multiple planetary systems that have been discovered by the radial velocity technique in this manner. Similar techniques can and will be employed to analyse any astrometric wobble. An interesting plot is to show the motion of the Sun in the plane of our solar system, in the rest frame of the solar system centre of mass. The Sun executes a complicated trajectory in this plot due primarily to the influence of Jupiter (on an 11 year orbit), but with superimposed &quot;epicycles&quot; due to the influence of the smaller planets on different orbital periods.

Generally, if tidal-locking half-time between the planets is much shorter than the tidal-locking half-time between the star and the planet, the planets will tidal-lock to each other rather than to the star. So we ask, whether &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$ \frac{A^6}{  M_s^3} \ll \frac{a^6}{  M_s M_p^2}\;,$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;where $A$ is the semi-major axis of the orbit of the double-planet. For typical planet in the habitable zone of the red dwarf star, $a$ = 9,000,000,000 m (0.06 AU), while the distance of the double-planet could be for example $A$ = 30,000,000 m. $M_s = 6\times 10^{24}\;\mathrm{kg}$ and $M_p = 2.9\times 10^{29}\;\mathrm{kg}$. We get&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$2\cdot 10^{-41}\ll 6.3\cdot 10^{-36}\;,$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;which is well-satisfied and the planets will tidal lock to each other rather than to the parent star. Were the distance between the planets $A$ = 300,000,000 m, the inequality would yield &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$2\cdot 10^{-35}\ll 6.3\cdot 10^{-36}\;,$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;which is not satisfied and the tidal forces of the star would probably disrupt the double-planet.

Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$v = D \times H(t)$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting this equation is slightly vacuous as it is merely the definition of recessional velocity, which is not something that can be directly measured.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As recessional velocity depends not just on a function of $t$, but also on $D$, the question as to whether objects are receding from us faster than ever before could be answered in several ways. Before I look at the different ways we could answer your question, I will note a few things. Firstly the definition of the Hubble parameter is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$H^2(t) = \bigg( \frac{\dot{a}(t)}{a(t)}\bigg)^2$ &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;where $a(t)$ is the scale factor which describes how the scale of the Universe changes with $t$ and $\dot{a}(t)$ is the first derivative of the scale factor with respect to $t$. Due to cosmological observations the Universe is said to contain dark energy which causes the Universe's expansion to accelerate. What is meant by this is that at the current time $\ddot{a}(t) &amp;gt; 0$ where $\ddot{a}(t)$ is the second derivative of the scale factor with respect to time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first way we could look at your question is we could ask whether galaxies currently at at a distance $D_0$ are receding faster than galaxies that were previously at the same distance were in the past when they were at that distance. From the definition of accelerating expansion and the Hubble parameter we can see that accelerating expansion does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; imply that the answer to this question is &quot;yes&quot; and in fact if we assume dark energy takes the form of a cosmological constant, ignoring cosmic inflation and we delve into the dynamics of the Universe with find that galaxies currently at $D_0$ must be receding from us slower than the galaxies that were previously at $D_0$ were receding when they were at $D_0$. So in this particular sense the Universe's expansion is slowing down, even though we usually describe it as accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second way we could answer your question is to ask whether the recessional velocity of any given galaxy is larger now than it has ever been in the past. The answer to this question is more difficult as accelerated expansion does imply that the recessional velocity of a given galaxy increase with time, but the Universe's rate of expansion in previous epochs was decelerating. However, again taking dark energy as taking the form of a cosmological constant, we see that the answer is that galaxies achieve their highest recessional velocities twice: firstly at the big bang and secondly in the infinite future. So the answer to this question is that galaxies are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; currently receding from us faster than they have been at all previous times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recession velocity is different from peculiar velocity (i.e. the local velocity wrt to the CMB). We could add the two to find the 'real velocity', but as I've noted recession velocity doesn't have a direct physical meaning so what this 'real velocity' actually means is not straightforward. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Expansion is homogeneous, whereas the vacuum around a black hole is not homogeneous, so in this sense the 'sucking' of a black hole is not the opposite of expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2092" LastEditorUserId="128" LastEditDate="2015-10-08T07:14:17.773" LastActivityDate="2015-10-08T07:14:17.773" CommentCount="1" />

First, any &quot;bright objects&quot;, while capable of &lt;a href=&quot;http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/117101/can-the-sun-cast-a-shadow&quot;&gt;casting a shadow of something &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, will emit electromagnetic radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so why can't there just be non-extremely luminous objects casting a shadow? One reason is that the dark matter simply isn't where these shadows should be. Many galaxies have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter_halo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;dark matter halo&lt;/a&gt; that extends far beyond the galactic plane. Any light sources emitting light (that is then shadowed) would have to be on the opposite side of the galactic disk. This is simply not the case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second, more convincing, reason is that dark matter has mass. In fact, that's the reason the idea was first conceived (to account for anomalies in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_rotation_curve&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;galactic rotation curves&lt;/a&gt;)! Shadows don't have mass; therefore, dark matter cannot be explained by shadows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Is that also why it has to get dark before we can really see the majority of stars (subjective experience)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No. I don't know for sure, but I believe that that's because the Sun's light is still blocking out the light of distant stars.&lt;sup&gt;[citation needed]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addendum after edit to question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Can you provide sources for your claims?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that they're pretty well sourced! The first section can easily be checked via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; (which I assumed you had seen). The rest seems to be well-sourced, too (aside from the last bit, which is, admittedly, unsourced but only tangential).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Also I didn't say you can't have DARK MATTER without Light , I said you can't have Dark, as in Darkness. I think you're getting hung up on Dark Matter which is a big part of my question, but not the entire question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Okay, I may have misinterpreted this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Darkness is, by definition, the absence of light (electromagnetic radiation). So no, you don't have to have light for there to be darkness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Also, are you claiming that all darkness in space is dark matter? I don't like to assume but for scientific purposes (not an accredited scientist) would we not agree that the measures made on dark matter were on a sample, and not the entire universe?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I never said that, but you did. Your original question asked if dark matter could be shadows. The answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;So to further question this, do shadows not exist in space?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They exist.

This was achieved by studying the position of many stars in Andromeda over a 7 year period using the Hubble Space Telescope. The details can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.6863&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sohn et al.

This galaxy is at 50 million light years, but the motion of the jet is only detectable here because it is moving relativistically.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are quite special cases. In general, the tangential velocities of stars in our Galaxy are small and large-scale susrveys of proper motions are generally inaccurate beyond a few thousand light years. The upcoming Gaia results will improve this dramatically meaning we have good proper motions for objects out to tens of thousands of light years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2531" LastEditorUserId="2531" LastEditDate="2015-03-18T12:08:32.280" LastActivityDate="2015-03-18T12:08:32.280" CommentCount="0" />

The Far Arm was &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.1752v2.pdf&quot;&gt;only discovered recently&lt;/a&gt;, while the Near Arm was first observed about 50 years ago. These two mini-arms are expanding outward at an enormous rate. The combined 3 kpc Arm then becomes the Perseus Arm, which extends out to about 3.5 times the distance from the center of the 3 kpc Arm. It is the other major spiral arm of the Milky Way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so that's simple enough. The Milky Way has four spiral arms, right? Well . . . sort of. &lt;a href=&quot;http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/798/2/L27/pdf/2041-8205_798_2_L27.pdf&quot;&gt;The discovery of the &quot;New Outer Arm&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; shook things up, because that would mean that the Norma-Outer Arm reaches nearly &lt;em&gt;all the way around the Milky Way.&lt;/em&gt; That's strange and borderline inexplicable.

The Spitzer study detected hot objects visible in infrared. The CfA study used radio telescopes which can also detect colder objects such as supernova remnants, very young star formation regions and huge clouds of hydrogen gas. So it seems as though the older established star formation regions are mostly concentrated in two spiral arms, but that the very new star formation regions and the hydrogen clouds from which they form are also developing in two additional arms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If you were hovering above the Milky Way in a spacecraft using binoculars or a regular optical telescope, you would see two main arms. But if you also had a radio telescope with you, it would detect two more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other group of scientists referred to here &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2009-03&quot;&gt;used the Very Long Baseline Array&lt;/a&gt; to image the Milky Way with radio waves; their observations support the four-main arms model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So at the moment, I think the answer is four, though two arms are more distinct that the other two.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Dammit, paywall!

Together, the signals from these telescopes can be combined to give an angular resolution that can be (in the best circumstances) equivalent to a telescope with a diameter equal to the telescope separation. These measurements give the &lt;em&gt;angular&lt;/em&gt; size of the star, which must then be multiplied by their distances to get a physical diameter. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the most successful experiments is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHARA_array&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Chara array&lt;/a&gt;, which has yielded diameters for many nearby stars. Precisions can be as good as a few percent, but more usually 10% and of order 100 (predominantly nearby) stars have had their radii measured in this way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A second main direct technique is to use eclipsing binary systems. The measured light curve can be used in an almost model-independent way to estimate the radii of the two stars involved. Of course most eclipsing binaries are close pairs with short orbital periods and with orbital inclinations that allow us to see the eclipse. They are therefore highly prized objects. Radii can be measured with precisions of 1%. A reasonably complete catalogue of the $\sim 100$ known eclipsing binaries with precise radii can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.astro.keele.ac.uk/jkt/debcat/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another technique is lunar occultation. The passage of a star behind the limb of the moon results in a changing diffraction pattern that can be used to estimate the angular size of the star. Again a distance is required to convert this into an actual diameter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More distant stars are inaccessible - their angular diameters are simply too small. At the moment only indirect estimates of their radii are possible. For example, if we were to assume that a star radiates as a blackbody, then its luminosity ($L$), radius ($R$) and temperature ($T$) are related by Stefan's law.&#xA;$$ L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4,$$&#xA;where $\sigma$ is the Stefan constant. If the star has a measured flux at the Earth and we know how far away it is, then $L$ can be estimated. If we take a spectrum and estimate its temperature, then the equation above can be rearranged to give the radius in terms of the measured luminosity and temperature. Real stars are more complicated than blackbodies, but the principle is the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neither of the above techniques can work for black holes, and the sizes (event horizon or Schwarzschild radius) of black holes have not yet been directly measured. The physics of a black hole is relatively simple(!) and so there is a direct relationship between their Schwarzschild radii and their masses (modified somewhat by rotation). Basically it is 3 km multiplied by the mass in solar units. Therefore a measurement of the black hole mass gives its &quot;radius&quot;.

Measurements of the Venus magnetic field show several similarities, such as deflection of the solar winds and the reconnections in the tail of the magnetosphere, causing plasma circulations in the magnetosphere. The differences might explain the fact that some gasses and water are lost from the Venus atmosphere. The magnetic field of Venus is about 10 times smaller as the earth's magnetic field. The shape of the magnetic field is also different. Earth has a more sharp magnetotail facing away from the sun and Venus has a more comet shaped magnetotail. During the reconnections most of the plasma is lost in the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The article explains therefore that although Venus does not have an intrinsic magnetic field, but the interaction of the thick atmosphere with the solar winds causes an externally induced magnetic field, that deflect the particles of the solar winds.

This relation is based on the statistical relation that many atoms are packed together, but not physically interact. The increasing temperature and therefore increasing kynetic energy of the atoms is caused by the increasing chance that the atoms collide with each other more frequently when the volume decreases. The ideal gas law explains the first increase in temperature by increase of the kynetic energy of the atoms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The chain reaction first appears when the ideal gas law doesn't apply anymore. The further collapse of a large star cloud causes the center of the cloud to reach those levels of pressure, that atoms start to physically interact and the gas becomes a plasma.

So, if you notice some irony in my answer, please, it's because of this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two types of theories which fantasize about the end of the universe by end of times. I freely call those type the formula type and transcendental type theories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first theory I will only briefly describe, because they end up transcendental anyway. There are several models on the universe that will describe what the universe (or universes) looks like and how they will evolve in time. The problem with these models is the variable time. If you have an endless time or an endless amount of universes, you end up with an endless amount of possibilities, which will result in all things will eventually happen. So, somewhere in time or a universe we will all become filthy rich and marry a gorgeous, intelligent, funny, friendly, etc., woman/man that never says no (to you). Because of this anomaly scientists have started to theorize that time must end at some point. If you believe these models to be correct, the scientists might be right. The problem in this lies that you first must believe the model is right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The transcendental theories are a bit more difficult to explain and I will briefly leap out of astronomy into philosophy. In the 18th century a great philosopher wrote a book on the critique of pure reason (Kritik der reinen Vernunft). In this book he was looking for a transcendental doctrine of method and elements. The transcendental part of his doctrine was that it had to be build up on a priori knowledge that was not based on experience. This was his pure reason, because the elements and the methods are not tainted by (personal) experience from an observer. They are true in itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why is this interesting? Because Kant (that great philosopher) said that there were two transcendental elements, space and time. I will skip space, but must say something on time, because someone thinks it might end. Kant states that time is an a priori element of knowledge in pure form. Kant uses five reasons, why time is universal and not empirical. They all can be brought back to the fact that we cannot see things/phenomena to coexist together or successively when there is no concept of time. Therefore, time is an a priori element of pure form.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, what has this to do with the ending of the universe in respect to time? The theory you mentioned as heat death is such a transcendental theory. The theory states that the universe expands until the universe is too big to be heated by the energy provided by the matter in the universe. This theory models that the universe follow the same rules as any thermo dynamic system and therefore at a certain point in time all energy, matter and temperature are evenly distributed in this huge universe. Because all is evenly distributed no stars will be created and all processes come to a grinding halt. Since the state before, now and after are the same, the scientists now determine this as the end of time. The formula theories also end up making some theory that time will end.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem with these theories is that time will never end. According to Kant time is an a priori element of pure reason and will be there despite of what we observe. Because the state of the universe doesn't change, doesn't mean that there will be no time. Time has just stopped. Theories that state that time will end, do not comply with Kant's critique of pure reason, which states that time is the formal condition of all phenomena whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it didn't entirely answered your question, I hope it was entertaining and educational.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kind regards,&#xA;MacUserT&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6599" LastActivityDate="2015-03-18T20:01:12.007" CommentCount="0" />

For instance, to define the mass of the structure, you need to be able to count the number of particles in the structure. But how does one know where to stop counting in a more or less continuous field of particles? One way is to determine an approximate center of mass $x_\mathrm{CM}$ (approximate, since it can only be exact once all associated particles are defined), calculate the average density $\langle\rho\rangle$ inside a sphere centered on $x_\mathrm{CM}$ (which will be higher than the global average, since you started out on an overdensity), and increase the radius until $\langle\rho\rangle$ falls below some threshold (e.g. 200 times the global average). If the number of particles is too small, $\langle\rho\rangle$ will change a lot between each iteration, making your mass inaccurate.

The large moons (Jupiter's 4 Galilean satellites, Saturn's Titan, Neptune's Triton) are all substantially larger in the sky than the Sun is. I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; there are some satellites that are fairly close to the apparent size of the Sun, but I haven't done all the calculations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The apparent size of our Moon has changed over time, as the Moon has gradually moved farther away. We are coincidentally in a period of history in which it happens to be very nearly the same apparent size as the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The criterion for an exoplanet to have solar eclipses like the spectacular ones we have here on Earth is a moon that happens to have an angular size large enough to cover the photosphere, but not so large that it also hides the corona.

First of all, the Romans could, like the Greeks and Sumerians, could only see Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. These planets can be seen with the naked eye. However, the fact that the Romans could see these planets, didn't give all the planets latin names. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the Names of the planets were given by the ones that discovered them first, the planets would have Sumerian names. The answer to the question why the planets have latin names is because they don't. The first western scientist took over the Roman names, because latin was they scientific language of the middle ages and the renaissance. After the discovery of Uranus and Neptune these planets were not given these names by their discoverers. Only after longer controversy western astronomers have standardized the names of planets and moons according to Greek and Roman mytholohy, but this was only around the second half of the 19th century. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of the 20th century the IAU is setting the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming/#inss&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;standards&lt;/a&gt; for naming celestial bodies including planets. However, the IAU doesn't set the names, it only sets the standards. Newly discovered objects are now named according to these rules by their discoverers. Older planets are still living with their old names and for western astronomers those are still the names from Greek and Roman mythological figures. However, the IAU allows you to consistently name the planets by their Arabic or Chinese names. So, the question is valid, the text around your question is unfortunately not true, since the planets don't necessarily have Roman names. If you are An Asian person and correctly think the planets should have their Chinese names, because they were earlier in discovering these objects than the Romans (although not earlier than the Sumerians), you are allowed by the IAU (sic) to call them by their Chinese names.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6599" LastEditorUserId="1106" LastEditDate="2015-04-02T22:37:06.920" LastActivityDate="2015-04-02T22:37:06.920" CommentCount="5" />

The techniques that are used for finding exoplanets are incomplete - that is they are capable of finding planets around stars in some circumstances but not in others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, finding stars using the transit detection technique is more sensitive to planets that are (i) big, (ii) close to their parent star and (iii) orbiting their star with an edge-on orientation from our point of view. The doppler techniques are sensitive to (i) massive exoplanets, (ii) those that are close-in to their parent star, (iii) favour detection when the line of sight lies close to the orbital plane.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each detection method (and each observing strategy and telescope/satellite) has their own particular &lt;em&gt;selection bias&lt;/em&gt;, but overall the picture is that the census of exoplanets is more complete for close-in massive planets, and very incomplete for planets that are either small or orbiting with periods much longer than 10 years. Then at very large separations and very long orbital periods (think 100s of years), direct imaging surveys are again capable of spotting massive exoplanets. Microlensing observations are also capable of detecting even small planets at large distances from their star.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The result of all this is that any figure for the &lt;em&gt;observed&lt;/em&gt; fraction of stars with exoplanets or the number of exoplanets per star is a &lt;em&gt;lower limit&lt;/em&gt;.&#xA;The exception is where researchers try to account for the various selection effects and give a figure for the fraction of stars with certain types of planet in certain types of orbit around certain types of star.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the moment it looks like the modal number of exoplanets per star is at least 1. In other words it seems increasingly likely that most stars have exoplanets of one sort or another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some facts and figures. From Kepler transit data, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/110/48/19273.abstract&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Petigura et al. (2013)&lt;/a&gt; say that 22% of Sun-like stars have &quot;Earth-sized&quot; planets orbiting &lt;em&gt;in their habitable zone&lt;/em&gt; (my italics), but their plots show that the overall results for planets with orbital periods in the range 5-100 days (where Kepler is most sensitive), are that nearly 60% of stars have planets from Earth- to Jupiter- sized in this range. &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.0903&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cassan et al. (2012)&lt;/a&gt; use microlensing survey data to claim that 17% of stars have &quot;Jupiters&quot; at 0.5-10 au from their parent star, and that Neptune-sized or &quot;super-Earth&quot; sized objects orbit a further (approximately) 50% and 60% respectively. The combination of these figures also suggests multiple planets are not rare and indeed the title of their paper is &quot;One or more bound planets per Milky Way star from microlensing observations&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The frequency of multiple planet systems is also hard to assess. All the techniques are &lt;em&gt;capable&lt;/em&gt; of detecting certain types of multiple system, but equally all are capable of missing multiple planets even when they are there.&#xA;Kepler did detect many multiple transiting systems, so they are not rare.

The ~5000 stars that can be seen with the naked eye have a roughly &quot;lognormal&quot; distribution of distance. I show plots below which were generated from the most recent version of the Hipparcos parallax catalogue. Fig.1 shows results for all stars with $5.5&amp;lt;V&amp;lt;6.5$  (i.e. very faint naked eye stars). The Hipparcos catalogue is almost complete for these stars, though some stars are so far away that the distance is highly uncertain - nevertheless, the general picture should be ok.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The median distance is about 440 light years. But the premise of your question is I think, that you dispute that this is far enough for the non-spherical distribution of stars in our Galaxy to become apparent. The answer is actually that it is, but only just. The Sun is very close to the plane of the disk of our Galaxy. The scale height of stars above this disk varies depending on stellar age and mass. Very approximately, the exponential scale height is 300-500 light years for most of the stars in our Galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is just small enough that if we look at the demographics of stars in two Galactic latitude regions we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; see a difference. Fig. 2 below shows stars with $5.5&amp;lt;V&amp;lt;6.5$ at low Galactic latitudes (within 15 degrees of the plane in green) and more than 45 degrees from the plane (in blue). There is a clear and significant difference. More stars can be seen at greater distances towards the plane, betraying the non spherically-symmetric nature of stars in our Galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other words the structure of the Galaxy &lt;em&gt;is not&lt;/em&gt; too small to affect the distribution of naked eye stars. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we look at the Milky Way we are seeing millions of unresolved stars that are in general more distant still. The effects of the disk-like nature of the Galaxy become more apparent as one goes to greater distances. In particular, at high Galactic latitudes one simply runs out of stars and hence there is no uniformly illuminated sky - leading to Olber's paradox, as correctly stated in another answer. But at low latitudes, there are sufficient stars that in general, within the resolution of our eyes there are many stars whose light sums to provide a visual stimulus. This picture is interrupted by &lt;em&gt;dust&lt;/em&gt;. Dust in the Galaxy is even more concentrated towards the plane than the stars. It is for this reason that beyond a few thousand light years, dust plays a major role in shaping the Milky Way structures that we can see, effectively blocking light at very low Galactic latitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/nrkJX.png&quot; alt=&quot;Distribution of stellar distances for naked eye stars&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig 1: Probability distribution of distance for naked eye stars in the Hipparcos catalogue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/I5pyX.png&quot; alt=&quot;Distribution of distances for naked eye stars in two Galactic latitude zones&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig 2: Probability distribution of distance for naked eye stars divided into low and high Galactic latitude regions (i.e. towards and away from the Galactic plane)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IMPORTANT EDIT:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the answer was accepted I did a bit of double checking. I split the Hipparcos sample into bright ($V&amp;lt;6$, 5000 stars) and very bright ($V&amp;lt;3$, 173 stars) and looked at the distribution of stars per unit area on the sky as a function of Galactic latitude (Fig. 3). The results are shown below and more obviously make the point. It turns out that the asymmetry between in an out of the plane is clearly seen, even in the brighter sample. The reason is that the very bright stars are not &lt;em&gt;all that much&lt;/em&gt; closer than the bright stars. Perhaps a median of 200 light years vs 350 light years. Thus the scale height of the Galactic disc must be small enough that the difference from spherical symmetry is already appearent at these kinds of distances.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/lOpa1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Distribution of stars vs Galactic latitude&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig. 3: Normalised plot of number of stars per unit area versus Galactic latitude for a sample of bright and very bright stars. Note the concentration towards the Galactic plane&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;FURTHER EDIT: You can even see from the plot above that there is also a slight concentration towards negative latitudes; the peak density is around -5 to -10 degrees in both cases. This is likely because the Sun is above the Galactic plane at present (though I also wonder if dust plays a role). The Sun is currently 60 light years above the plane and heading upwards (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/822/how-far-is-the-earth-sun-above-below-the-galactic-plane-and-is-it-heading-towar&quot;&gt;How far is the Earth/Sun above/below the galactic plane, and is it heading toward/away from it?&lt;/a&gt; ).

The trick would be a sustained fission reaction, faster than half life, but slower than a chain reaction.   A chain reaction could hardly be considered &quot;star like&quot; - it would just explode.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lets say you had a planet sized object, maybe 100 parts Iron, basically inert, to 1 part Uranium  , which would generate heat through half life decay and some neutrons would spread from uranium to uranium - many wouldn't.  And as the object got hotter, more and more uranium would drift towards the center.  You'd have gradual heating, and the object, in time, would probobly begin to glow.     I'm guessing it's not possible using anything close to pure uranium, as the neutrons released in a uranium rich ball of matter would do 1 of 2 things - either blow the thing apart, or increase the rate of reaction and cause a chain reaction.   But i think, with the proper mix of uranium and inert elements, and the uranium spread out, not all in the center, you probobly could get something sort of star-like.   It would have much less available energy so it wouldn't burn nearly as long as a star.    At least, that's my thought experiment answer to this question.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem with nothing but heavy, neutron rich elements is that, I don't see any way that wouldn't cascade and burn or blow up quickly.   The nuclear reaction is driven by neutrons hitting the nucleus with potential energy and as the reaction happens, more free Neutrons are produced which speeds up the reaction significantly.   A ball of of Uranium many miles across would undergo fission and explode.   A ball heavy enough to not explode - say, jupiter sized, it would heat up and burn quickly and then settle down and cool off slowly. - perhaps similarish to a star going Nova then settling into a white dwarf.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have a material inside that slows the reaction, absorbs and re-admits Neutrons you could probobly generate a sustained burn - similar to what happens inside a nuclear plant while maintaining enough gravity to keep the object in one piece and over time, That would heat up and glow like a star in time and last for a while.   Planet sized, even moon sized would probobly be more than sufficient, but you'd need the material to slow the reaction and keep the Uranium spread out.

There are certain stars that we can individually observe, and that we believe could go supernova more-or-less at any moment. Betelgeuse is probably the most famous example. It's 640 light years away, it could go type II supernova any time (expected within the next million years, but could conceivably happen within the next 640 years as we observe it, such that it's already happened). It might become a black hole when it does (although a mere neutron star is also on the cards, I believe, and probably more likely).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, when we observe a distant galaxy it is certain (as far as our theories are concerned) that some of the stars contributing to the light from that galaxy have since become black holes. However, since we aren't resolving individual stars in those galaxies even with our best telescopes, you could have an argument whether we're &quot;seeing&quot; the stars or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;is it safe to say that most of the stars are already dead that we see?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way, no. It's only around 100k light years across, it contains 100 billion - 1 trillion stars, of which we can individually &quot;see&quot; only a small proportion. Most of those are very close, the furthest around 1500 light years, and most of &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; are not supernova candidates at all, let alone black hole candidates. Even allowing for our best telescopes, we still only resolve a small proportion of stars individually.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The galaxy probably experiences roughly one supernova every 50-100 years. So even if all of those were visible stars (which they aren't: even of the largest stars in the galaxy only a small proportion can be seen with the naked eye), and all the supernovae resulted in black holes (which they don't), then at most 15-30 naked-eye-visible stars could already be black holes, and only up to 1000-2000 total stars in the whole galaxy regardless of visibility are in the duration between going supernova, and earth entering the future light cone of that supernova. This &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; loose upper bound is by no means &quot;most of the stars that we see&quot;, and in fact the chances are that none of the stars you see when you look up at the night sky are already black holes. It might well be that none of them ever will be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's also unlikely that any star you observe with the naked eye is dead, since their lifetimes are of the order of 10 million years (for the largest) to billions of years, and their distances from earth are 1500 light years or less. But there are a few stars, like Betelgeuse, that we know are near the ends of their life and that therefore might be &quot;already dead&quot; in this sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using telescopes we can see some individual stars in nearby galaxies, or at least indirectly observe them since they're lighting up nebulae that we see, up to a few tens of millions of light years away (these tend to be blue supergiants, I think). Of these, those on course to turn into a black hole may well have lifetimes less than or equal to their distance from us. It's not necessarily the case that all or even most of them become black holes, I'm not sure what's typical of the types of star in question, but for those stars you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; say that many or most are already black holes. The most distant individually-resolved stars are all dead one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you allow for us &quot;seeing&quot; each star in a very distant galaxy, even though we can't resolve any of them individually before they supernova, then the numbers change again, but my instinct is that it's not the case that &quot;most&quot; of the observable universe is already collapsed into black holes. But the stars may well be dead even though they aren't black holes. We can see galaxies 10+ billion light years away, which is about the entire lifetime of a star like the Sun. To come up with &quot;most&quot;, though, you have to firstly agree what counts as a star and secondly survey what kinds of star those galaxies contain. If you end up concluding that most stars are (by comparison with the Sun) tiny little red-brown things with lifetimes in the tens of billions of years, then most stars aren't already dead no matter how far away the galaxy they're in :-) On the other hand, the brighter objects that contribute most of what we observe via telescope in the most distant galaxies, sure, certainly die in far less than a few billion years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that in special relativity the concept of &quot;simultaneous&quot; is a bit difficult to pin down. But I've followed the convention that if something is X light years away, then anything we observe from it between now and X years from now, has &quot;already happened&quot;. We're not necessarily entitled from where we're standing to say that it's &quot;already happened&quot;, since it's not in our past light cone, but good enough :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6953" LastEditorUserId="6953" LastEditDate="2015-03-31T11:27:41.053" LastActivityDate="2015-03-31T11:27:41.053" CommentCount="0" />

These assumptions, together called &quot;the cosmological principle&quot;, are that the Universe is homogeneous, and that it's isotropic.

Which of these possible universes &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; live in, turns out to depend upon the average density in the Universe, so by measuring this, we can determine the &quot;geometry&quot; of our own Universe.

And it seems that the Universe not only expands, but actually &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_universe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;expands faster and faster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Beyond the layman's explanation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here, I'll expand a bit on how to understand the equation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Friedmann equations are intuitively most understandable, I think, when combined and written like this:&#xA;$$\frac{H^2}{H_0^2} = &#xA;\frac{\Omega_\mathrm{r,0}}{a^4} +&#xA;\frac{\Omega_\mathrm{M,0}}{a^3} +&#xA;\frac{\Omega_k}{a^2} +&#xA;      \Omega_\mathrm{\Lambda}.$$&#xA;This equation tells us the connection between the expansion rate of the Universe (the left hand side), and the density of its components and its size (the right hand side). Below, I'll go through the components of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hubble parameter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In the equation, $H$ is the Hubble parameter describing how fast a galaxy at a given distance recedes (or approaches, for a collapsing universe), at a given time in the history of the Universe. $H_0$ is its value &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;, and is measured to be roughly $70\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. This means that a galaxy at a distance of, say, 70 Mpc (=230 lightyears), moves away from us at a current speed of 70 km/s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The size of the Universe is unknown, and probably infinite. Thus, we cannot talk about its absolute size. But we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; talk about how much a certain volume of space expands in a given time. We us the parameter $a$, called the expansion factor. Defing $a$ to be 1 today, that means that at the time when the Universe was so small that all distances between the galaxies was, say, half of today's values, $a$ was equal to 0.5 (this happens to be 8 billion years ago).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Density parameters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Whether the geometry of the Universe as described above is flat, closed, or open, depends on whether the &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; density $\rho_\mathrm{tot}$ is exactly equal to, above, or below a certain critical threshold $\rho_\mathrm{cr} \sim 10^{-29}\,\mathrm{g}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. It is customary to parametrize the density of the $i$'th component as $\Omega\equiv \rho_i / \rho_\mathrm{cr}$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The term &quot;matter&quot; includes &quot;normal&quot; matter (gas, stars, planets, bicycles, etc.), and the mysterious dark matter. As the universe expands, the volume grows as $a^3$. That means that the density falls as $\Omega_\mathrm{M}=\Omega_\mathrm{M,0}/a^3$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radiation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Photons redshift as space expands, and this redshift goes as $1/a$. This is in addition to having their &lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt; density decrease, so the total energy density of radiation decreases faster than matter, namely as $1/a^4$. Today, the energy density of radiation is dominated by the CMB, and can be neglected, but in the early times, they would dominate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curvature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If space is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; flat, its curvature contributes to $\Omega_\mathrm{tot}$. The reason is that the curvature affects the volume in which we measure densities (thanks to John Davis for this explanation). This scales as $1/a^2$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dark energy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Finally, there's the magical dark energy, of which even less is known than the dark matter. If it exists, it's thought to be a property of space itself, i.e. its energy density grows proportionally to the volume of the Universe, and thus there's no $a$-dependency.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the equation, it is readily seen that if we're able to measure all the Omegas, then we know how fast the Universe has been expanding at all times. That means that we can integrate backwards in time and calculate when $a$ was 0, i.e. we can calculate the age of the Universe. Also, from the $a$-dependencies we can see when the Universe went from being &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation-dominated_era&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;radiation-dominated to being  matter-dominated&lt;/a&gt;. We can also see that not only is it now dominated by dark energy (since $\Omega_\mathrm{\Lambda}\simeq0.7$, but $\Omega_\mathrm{M}\simeq0.3$), but due to the $a$ factor, it will only get &quot;worse&quot;. That is, all other densities will keep decreasing, but $\rho_\Lambda$ stays the same, and since dark energy has a repulsive effect rather than attracting, the expansion of the Universe accelerates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Observationally, it is found (in several &lt;em&gt;independent&lt;/em&gt; ways) that all the $\Omega$s add up to one, i.e. that the total energy density of the Universe happens to be exactly equal to the critical density. This is pretty amazing. This figure, taken from &lt;a href=&quot;http://wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov/media/080998/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, shows the contribution from the different components now (top), and at the time of the CMB emission (380,000 yr after the Big Bang; bottom):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/94t86.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;lagkage&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5264" LastEditorUserId="5264" LastEditDate="2016-03-14T15:28:36.183" LastActivityDate="2016-03-14T15:28:36.183" CommentCount="8" />

[A normal gas would contract and become hotter as it loses energy!]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The end result for a $0.5M_{\odot}$ star will be a helium white dwarf with a mass (depending on uncertain details of the mass-loss process) of around $0.2M_{\odot}$.

The collapse to a degenerate state would be &lt;strong&gt;inevitable&lt;/strong&gt; even for the lowest mass stars (which would of course then be very low-mass white dwarfs). As an inert core contracts it loses heat and cools - a higher density and lower temperate eventually lead to degenerate conditions that allow the core to cool without losing pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lowest mass stars ($&amp;lt;0.3 M_{\odot}$) do get there via a slightly different route - they are fully convective, so the &quot;core&quot; doesn't exist really, it is always mixed with the envelope.

This should have an effect in two ways. For the same mass, the brown dwarf should end up bigger because the number of mass units per electron is smaller (1 vs 2) and also because the effects of a finite temperature are larger in material with fewer mass units per particle - i.e. its outer, non-degenerate layer would be more &quot;puffed up&quot;.

The pulsar provides an extremely precise ticking clock with which to study the motion of stars in a binary system. The pulsar is in orbit with a companion that is also a neutron star (though not an observable pulsar). The orbit is elliptical with a period of 7.75 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The period of the orbits is decreasing. That is, the two stars are gradually getting closer together. This effect is a consequence of general relativity, that predicts that such massive objects that are so close to each other will act as a source of gravitational waves. The gravitational waves have not (yet) been directly observed, but GR makes a prediction for how much energy they carry away and hence at what rate the orbital period changes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rate of decrease in the distance between two bodies is given by&#xA;$$\frac{dr}{dt} = -\frac{64G^3}{5c^5}\frac{(m_1 m_2)(m_1+m_2)}{r^3}$$ &#xA;and leads to a merger between the two objects in a time of&#xA;$$t = \frac{5c^5}{256G^3}\frac{r^4}{(m_1 m_2)(m_1+m_2)}, $$&#xA;where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two orbiting bodies, $G$ is the gravitational constant and $c$ is the speed of light.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In slightly more friendly units&#xA;$$ \frac{dr}{dt} = 7.8\times10^{-19} \frac{(M_1 M_2)(M_1+M_2)}{r^3}\ au/yr,$$&#xA;where $r$ is in astronomical units and the masses are in solar masses, and&#xA;$$ t = 3.2\times10^{17} \frac{R^4}{(M_1 M_2)(M_1+M_2)}\ yr. $$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus you can see that the effect gets much stronger (and the merger times shorter) if you have &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; high mass objects (it depends on the product of the masses) with a small orbital separations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For &quot;normal&quot; stars you can never get them closer than their stellar radii and generally means that the effect is too small to be important. However, compact objects (white dwarfs and neutron stars) can be brought much closer together and this is why the effect has been seen there. The Hulse-Taylor binary components &#xA;have masses of $\sim 1.4 M_{\odot}$ and are separated by an average of about 2 million km (0.013 au). Inserting this into the formula above give a merger time of 1.7 billion years. A more accurate calculation that takes account of the elliptical orbit gives 300 million years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, if you made the neutron stars orbit with a separation of 0.1 au (more typical for a normal stellar binary system), the merger timescale would increases to well beyond the current age of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2531" LastActivityDate="2015-04-03T11:59:15.630" CommentCount="0" />

It's not likely to have a planet orbiting near a black hole and in significant time dilation because the tidal effects would likely tear anything that close apart.   Certainly a planet orbiting a stellar mass black hole would need to be quite far away so as to not be torn apart, so any time dilation would be pretty small.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Around a super-massive black hole, the tidal effects are smaller and a nearish orbit with some measure of time dilation is possible.

The idea of 1 day to 100 years isn't practical, it's 80 days to 100 days if you're talking about a stable planetary orbit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and, I'm not sure you'd want to be that close to the black hole in the center of the universe, not because the orbit isn't stable, but because stars are in that orbit too.  It might not be a safe place to be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, in reality, you'd want a stellar mass black hole and a distant orbit, where the time dilation would be quite small, and in that scenario, yes, life is possible because of tidal energy, so a planet could have liquid surface water and an atmosphere, even if the black hole gave off very little light and heat.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Such a planet in a tidal-energy orbit would probably be tidally locked which would protect the far side from any gamma rays the black hole spits out when it eats, so it would in theory be a good place for life.   No significant light source, unless it was a binary system, so, plants would have it harder, but there would be heat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's another problem.   The creation of black holes tends to blow everything appart in a huge explosion.  It's unclear that a planet would survive a black hole's birth, so you might need a captured planet.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, intelligent life . . . we really don't know enough about how common intelligent life is on other planets.   Life might be fairly enough, but intelligent life is far less clear and there's other factors than just time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today, we simply don't know enough to predict if there's intelligent life out there or not.   There probably is life elsewhere in the universe, though even that isn't 100% certain, but intelligent life, there's far too many unknowns in that equation.   But I think a black hole might not be optimal for the formation intelligent life because of the lack of light so, much less photosynthesis, so, slower oxygen formation (if it follows the same pattern the earth does) and the unlikeliness that a planet would survive the black hole's creation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6841" LastActivityDate="2015-04-04T09:11:45.357" CommentCount="2" />

The core collapses from something a little smaller than the radius of the Earth, to about 10km radius in a fraction of a second. Conservation of angular momentum demands that the rotation rate increases as the inverse of the radius &lt;em&gt;squared&lt;/em&gt;. i.e. The spin rate increases by factors of a million or so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pulsars spin down with age because they turn their rotational kinetic energy into magnetic dipole radiation. However, the fastest rotating pulsars - the &quot;milli-second pulsars&quot; are &quot;born again&quot;, by accreting material from a binary companion.

Think of a single point explosion, at any given time, the object twice as far should be moving twice as fast, cause they both started in the same place at the same time, so twice as fast moves twice s far.   There are, complications - with the explosion there's air resistance, with the universe well, I'll get to that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Doesn’t this seem to indicate that the expansion of the universe is&#xA;  slowing down, because the more recent light from galaxies, appears to&#xA;  be moving away slower? Does this make sense?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OK, it sounds like you have an incorrect assumption there.   Expansion means the far away is moving away faster and the closer is moving away slower, that's true with accelerating or decelerating expansion.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What they look for when studying expansion is measuring the precise speed and comparing that to distance.   In steady expansion, you expect to see the galaxy 8 billion light years away to be apparently moving away twice as fast as the galaxy 4 billion light years away.  (I say apparently cause we can only observe the relative velocity from 8 billion years in the past).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, whether the galaxy 8 billion light years is traveling slightly more or slightly less than twice as fast away from us as the galaxy 4 billion light years away - that's what tells us about acceleration vs deceleration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a car driving 60 MPH, and the driver puts the ever so slightest pressure on one of the pedals, but you don't know which one, and similarly the car driving 30 MPH does the same, but we can only see how fast the 60 MPH car was driving 6 minutes ago and we see how fast the car driving 30 was driving 3 minutes ago - that gives the 30 MPH car more time to apply the acceleration or deceleration.    It's that time differential that gives us the information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, like the cars above, the galaxy 4 billion light years away has been in the accelerating expansion of space longer than the one 8 billion years ago and that's what tells us that the acceleration of expansion is happening, the nearer galaxies are moving a bit faster away from us than they would in a steady expansion or a gravitationally slowed expansion.

But on the other hand, estimates of the abundances of deuterium, helium, tritium and lithium produced in the big bang indicate that only 5% of the density of the universe can be in the form of normal matter (e.g atoms, protons, neutrons etc). As brown dwarfs are made of these things, they can only &lt;em&gt;contribute&lt;/em&gt; to this small percentage and cannot be responsible for most of the dark matter (the same is true for anything made of normal, &quot;baryonic matter&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astronomers have &lt;em&gt;counted&lt;/em&gt; how many brown dwarfs there are, both in the local neighbourhood and in star clusters (see for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...683L.183A&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Andersen et al. 2008&lt;/a&gt;;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJS..197...19K&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kirkpatrick et al. 2011&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJS..197...19K&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Burningham et al. 2013&lt;/a&gt;; . In other words we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; see brown dwarfs - they emit most of their light in the infrared part of the spectrum, and surveys like SDSS, 2MASS and WISE have uncovered them in their thousands. It turns out that there is about 1 brown dwarf for every 4 more massive stars. So, although numerous, they contribute a very tiny fraction of the normal matter in our Galaxy. In addition, microlensing experiments towards the Galactic bulge and Magellanic clouds suggest that although there are lots of brown dwarfs elsewhere in our Galaxy (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...542..281A&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Alcock et al. 2000&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008A%26A...480..723C&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Novati et al. 2008&lt;/a&gt;), there are not enough to make much of a contribution to dark matter, and so the results from our solar neighbourhood appear representative of the Galaxy as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2531" LastEditorUserId="2531" LastEditDate="2015-04-05T15:01:38.230" LastActivityDate="2015-04-05T15:01:38.230" CommentCount="7" />

When we talk about measuring the temperature of a star, the only stars we can actually resolve and measure are in the local universe; they do not have appreciable redshifts and so this is rarely of any concern. Stars do of course have line of sight velocities which give their spectrum a redshift (or blueshift). It is a reasonably simple procedure to correct for the line of sight velocity of a star, because the redshift (or blueshift) applies to all wavelengths equally and we can simply shift the wavelength axis to account for this. i.e. We put the star back into the rest-frame before analysing its spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gerald has talked about the blackbody spectrum - indeed the wavelength of the peak of a blackbody spectrum is inversely dependent of temperature through &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien%27s_displacement_law&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wien's law&lt;/a&gt;. This method could be used to estimate the temperatures of objects that have spectra which closely approximate blackbodies and for which flux-calibrated spectra are available that properly sample the peak. Both of these conditions are hard to satisfy in practice: stars are in general not blackbodies, though their &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; temperatures - which is usually what is quoted, are defined as the temperature of a blackbody with the same radius and luminosity of the star.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;effective temperature&lt;/em&gt; of a star is most accurately measured by (i) estimating the total flux of light from the star; (ii) getting an accurate distance from a parallax; (iii) combining these to give the luminosity; (iv) measuring the radius of the star using interferometry; (v) this gives the effective temperature from Stefan's law:&#xA;$$ L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T_{eff}^4,$$&#xA;where $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Unfortunately the limiting factor here is that it is difficult to measure the radii of all but the largest or nearest stars. So measurements exist for a few giants and a few dozen nearby main sequence stars; but these are the fundamental calibrators against which other techniques are compared and calibrated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A second major secondary technique is a detailed analysis of the spectrum of a star. To understand how this works we need to realise that (i) atoms/ions have different energy levels; (ii) the way that these levels are populated depends on temperature (higher levels are occupied at higher temperatures); (iii) transitions between levels can result in the emission or absorption of light at a particular wavelength that depends on the energy difference between the levels.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To use these properties we construct a model of the atmosphere of a star. In general a star is hotter on the inside and cooler on the outside. The radiation coming out from the centre of the star is absorbed by the cooler, overlying layers, but this happens preferentially at the wavelengths corresponding to energy level differences in the atoms that are absorbing the radiation. This produces absorption lines in the spectrum. A spectrum analysis consists of measuring the strengths of these absorption lines for many different chemical elements and different wavelengths. The strength of an absorption line depends primarily on (i) the temperature of the star and (ii) the amount of a particular chemical element, but also on several other parameters (gravity, turbulence, atmospheric structure). By measuring lots of lines you isolate these dependencies and emerge with a solution for the temperature of the star - often with a precision as good as +/-50 Kelvin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where you don't have a good spectrum, the next best solution is to use the colour of the star to estimate its temperature. This works because hot stars are blue and cool stars are red. The colour-temperature relationship is calibrated using the measured colours of the fundamental calibrator stars. Typical accuracies of this method are +/- 100-200 K (poorer for cooler stars).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2531" LastEditorUserId="2531" LastEditDate="2015-04-05T17:10:36.317" LastActivityDate="2015-04-05T17:10:36.317" CommentCount="0" />

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Roche limit&lt;/a&gt; for the breakup of a rigid object occurs when the &#xA;object is a distance &#xA;$$d = 1.26 R \left(\frac{\rho_{NS}}{\rho_O}\right)^{1/3},$$&#xA;where $\rho_{NS}$ and $\rho_O$ are the average densities of our neutron star and object respectively. For rocky material, $\rho_O \simeq 5000$ kg/m$^{3}$. For our fiducial neutron star $\rho_{NS} \simeq 7\times10^{17}$ kg/m$^{3}$. Thus when the object gets closer than $d= 500,000$ km it will disintegrate into its constituent atoms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It will thus arrive in the vicinity of the neutron star as an extremely hot, ionised gas. But if the material has even the slightest angular momentum it could not fall directly onto the neutron star surface without first shedding that angular momentum. It will therefore form (or join) an accretion disk. As angular momentum is transported outwards, material can move inwards until it is hooked onto the neutron star magnetic field and makes its final journey onto the neutron surface, probably passing through an accretion shock as it gets close to the magnetic pole, if the object is already accreting strongly. Roughly a few percent of the rest mass energy is converted into kinetic energy and then heat which is partly deposited in the neutron star crust along with matter (nuclei and electrons) and partly radiated away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the high densities in the outer crust the raw material (certainly if it contains many protons) will be burned in rapid nuclear reactions. If enough material is accreted in a short time this can lead to a runaway thermonuclear burst until all the light elements have been consumed. Subsequent electron captures make the material more and more neutron rich until it settles down to the equilibrium composition of the crust, which consists of neutron-rich nuclei and ultra-relativistically degenerate electrons (no free neutrons).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2531" LastActivityDate="2015-04-06T15:23:16.917" CommentCount="0" />

Simulations can reproduce such structures, but they do not explain &quot;why&quot; they look the way they do.  The clue lies in the geometric appearance of the structures: The voids resemble the elements of a Voronoi tessellation in which the walls of the Voronoi polyhedra intersect in lines that are identified with the filaments.  We need to understand the dynamics that generated this pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At around 2:30 the movie addresses the issue of why it looks the way it does using a simple ballistic model for the motion of a set of discrete particles that represent a random density field (the Zel'dovich model).  The filaments are there but too fuzzy.  So at ~3:00 it generalizes this so as to achieve greater realism by making the particles sticky.  This is the &quot;adhesion model&quot;, which is governed by the Burgers-Hopf equation, which is easily solved by geometric means.  There is no gravity in this - it's ballistics acting on density field generated by a Gaussian Random process with a known covariance function (or power spectrum).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The adhesion model is a remarkable representation of the structure.  It shows how nothing &quot;special&quot; is required to generate the pattern of the cosmic web.

In terms of &lt;em&gt;terrestrial&lt;/em&gt; type planets, i.e. those of size less than a few Earth radii, the constraints are confined to comparing the measured densities (obtained from the masses and radii of transiting planets found by Kepler and CoRoT) with models of what planets with certain assumed composition would look like. An excellent recent example of this can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...800..135D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dressing et al. (2015)&lt;/a&gt;.

The plot below, taken from that paper, illustrates the available data and should be quite up-to-date. Note how all the low-mass planets (and the Earth and Venus) can lie on the same family of models.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/0pKj2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Planet mass vs radius from Dressing et al. (2015)&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think that the authors are claiming that this is exactly what all the planets are made of, but simply illustrating that at present there do not seem to be any large deviations from such a composition (for example, planets that are made solely of iron). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are relatively few planets on this diagram, because it is difficult to obtain the masses of small transiting planets (it requires detection of the doppler shift caused by the pull of the planet on its host star).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course different models yield somewhat different results. For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012A%26A...541A.103W&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wagner et al. (2012)&lt;/a&gt; used the same data for Kepler-10b and CoRoT-7b and their own detailed models to argue that these planets have an iron core that makes up about 60% of the planet - i.e. a lot more than makes up the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the moment the data for the lowest mass planets currently indicate that there &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; only be a limited amount of diversity. But the information that we are working with, the sample size, and the fact that only masses and radii are&#xA;determined, is too sparse to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a theoretical point of view there are many ideas. The basic concept about the formation of the terrestrial-type planets is that they form (relatively) close in to the parent star and have compositions that are reflective of what elements and minerals can condense out of the protoplanetary disk at high temperatures. This in turn depends on the balance of elements that are present in the protoplanetary disk, where in the disk the planet forms, the detailed structure of the protoplanetary disk, how it cools and how planets migrate in the disk.  Unsurprisingly, by varying some of these conditions it is possible to create planets with a wide variety of compositions, which as I said above, appears to be mildly contradicted by the available evidence. At the most basic level we understand why the Earth and other terrestrial planets are comparatively lacking in &quot;volatile&quot; elements like hydrogen and helium (and to some extent C, N, O and noble gases), because they (or minerals containing them) could not condense at the high temperatures close to the proto-Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Examples of these theoretical approaches can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...787...81M&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Moriarty et al.

(2012)&lt;/a&gt; for examples of how chemical diversity might arise. It seems that the Mg/Si and the C/O ratios have the biggest influence on the final compositions of the formed planets. A low C/O ratio favours the formation of silicates and fewer carbon-carrying compounds; but if there is more carbon than oxygen then it becomes more favourable to form carbon and silicon-carbide (I guess this is what you mean by &quot;carbon planets&quot;), but this also depends on the temperature in the region where the planet forms. For reference, the solar C/O ratio is 0.54 and the relative abundance of carbon in the Earth is much lower (than in the Sun) but the C/O ratio measured in other stars can be higher.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2531" LastActivityDate="2015-04-09T13:48:39.043" CommentCount="0" />

If the gas were &lt;em&gt;optically thin&lt;/em&gt; to the CMB &amp;mdash; that is, if it were sufficiently dilute that CMB photons could easily penetrate &amp;mdash; it would quickly get reheated to the temperature of the CMB, i.e. 2.7 K. However, the Boomerang Nebula is optically thick (dense), so the CMB hasn't yet had the time to heat it. The temperature in its outer parts, however, is higher, and as the nebula expands further, it will eventually (on timescales of, say, 1000s of years) be heated not only by the CMB, but also by the central white dwarf, i.e. the remnant of the star that produced the nebula.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does an expanding gas cool?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The usual approach to explain this is to consider a gas in a piston. When the volume is increased, the gas molecules do work on the piston, and hence lose energy, so temperature decreases. However, in the case of the Boomerang Nebula, there are no walls on which the gas can do work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cosmologically speaking, the nebula expands rather quickly (it has &quot;only&quot; been expanding for ~1500 yr). Assuming that it doesn't have the time to exchange energy with its surrounding, the expanding is thus &lt;em&gt;adiabatic&lt;/em&gt;. For an ideal gas undergoing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_process#Ideal_gas_.28reversible_process.29&quot;&gt;reversible adiabatic expansion&lt;/a&gt; (or contraction), we know that&#xA;$$P V^\gamma = \mathrm{constant},$$&#xA;where $P$ and $V$ are the pressure and volume of the gas, respectively, and $\gamma$ is the &lt;em&gt;adiabatic index&lt;/em&gt;. For a monoatomic gas, $\gamma = 5/3$, but here there are probably also molecules, so it's probably somewhat higher. At any rate, it's higher than $1$, which is the important thing for us, as we shall see below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now the temperature $T$ of the gas can be obtained from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law&quot;&gt;ideal gas law&lt;/a&gt;:&#xA;$$P V = N k_\mathrm{B} T.$$&#xA;Here, $N$ is the total number of particles, and $k_\mathrm{B} = 1.38\times10^{-16}~\mathrm{erg}~\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ is a constant (Boltzmann's, to be specific).

This was advocated by Eddington back in the 1920's, but at that time your basic concern was a very real and major problem.  Objects with like electrical charges repel each other.  In particular, protons will repel other protons since all protons have a positive charge.  What they knew of the sun then indicated that the core was far too cold for protons to overcome this repulsion&amp;mdash;at least not even remotely close to the rate that was obviously necessary to produce a brightly shining sun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the development of quantum mechanics it was determined that a process known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;quantum tunneling&lt;/a&gt; would give two protons a non-zero probability of &quot;overcoming&quot; this repulsion.  But not in the sense of they just suddenly gain enough energy (hence why &quot;overcoming&quot; is in quotations).  Instead, in the sense that the &quot;fused together&quot; state has the same energy as the &quot;just about to repel each other before fusion can occur&quot; state, and they just randomly switched from the latter to the former, despite every intermediate stage between the two of them requiring more energy than is available.  That this is possible is one of the many non-intuitive features of quantum mechanics, and I think it would be beyond the scope of this question (and site) to try to get much more precise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, even this failed to explain why our sun was very obviously fusing atoms to the extent that it was.  If you fuse two protons together, you are left with an incredibly unstable state: the diproton.  As soon as one of these forms it pretty much immediately breaks up into two distinct protons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the late 30's Hans Bethe (a man who eventually won the Nobel prize and was a part of the Los Alamos team that developed the atom bomb) proposed that yet another random quantum mechanical event would save the day: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;beta decay&lt;/a&gt;, a feature of the recently discovered fundamental force known as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;weak force&lt;/a&gt;.  In this situation one of the protons in the diproton undergoes a beta decay into a neutron before the diproton separates, at which point you have a stable deuterium nucleus: one proton, and one neutron.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That so many unlikely events have to occur for two protons to produce one deuterium is the reason why the sun's lifetime is approximately 10 billion years.  That the sun shines as bright as it does is, as you suggest, a sheer numbers game: there are truly prodigious numbers of protons in the sun's core, so even though the proton-proton chain is really unlikely, we have so very many chances at it that there is a great many successful fusion events.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically every other stellar fusion reaction proceeds much more rapidly than those that produce deuterium.  You may be familiar with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermonuclear_weapon&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;hydrogen bomb&lt;/a&gt;, which fuses its fuel very rapidly.  One of the key differences (and there are many) between the hydrogen bomb and a star like our sun is that the bomb is fusing together deuterium (and tritium) into helium, and is not using the proton-proton chain.  Stars have to produce large supplies of deuterium directly, and this is a lengthy process that consumes roughly 90% of a star's life&amp;mdash;even for very massive stars, whose lifespans are orders of magnitude shorter than our Sun's.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Note that very massive stars are rather more complicated beasts, in fact, but this is again beyond the scope of this question)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2188" LastActivityDate="2015-04-12T07:00:44.060" CommentCount="1" />

The hemisphere coming towards us emits light that is is blue shifted, the hemisphere receding is redshifted. If we now take a &lt;em&gt;transiting&lt;/em&gt; planet, during the eclipse it crosses the disc of the star and obscures regions that are blue or red shifted by various amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now what you do is measure the line-of-sight velocity of the star. During the transit you would not expect this to vary due to the &quot;Doppler wobble&quot; caused by the exoplanet, except that if the planet obscures a blue shifted portion of the stellar disc, the net spectral absorption line that remains shifts to the red, and vice-versa. The pattern of red, then blue shift (or vice versa) as the transit progresses is known as the Rossiter-Mclaughlin effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A schematic showing how the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect works and how a different transit geometry with respect to the rotation axis of the star leads to a different line-of-sight-velocity signature in the spectral lines of the star.

Thus the stellar absorption lines show a redshift followed by a symmetric blueshift. If the planet was retrograde it would be symmetric but occur in the opposite order. A Polar orbit would show no RM effect. Inclined orbits would have an asymmetric RM effect - ie perhaps more blueshift than redshift (see image above, right).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The RM effect cannot give an exact orientation, it gives the projected angle between orbital and rotation axes on the plane of the sky. Nevertheless, that is sufficient for us to know that a lot of the transiting exoplanets have highly misaligned orbital and stellar rotation axes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2531" LastEditorUserId="2531" LastEditDate="2015-04-13T08:43:03.573" LastActivityDate="2015-04-13T08:43:03.573" CommentCount="1" />

If you're far from any gravitating matter, time passes &quot;normally&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But to answer your question, we must specify what is meant by &quot;the black holes's time&quot; (let's call the black hole $\mathrm{BH}_\mathrm{Sgr\,A^*}$; see note below on the nomenclature), since it depends on how far from Sgr A* we are talking. The time pace at a distance $r$ from the center of a BH is given by&#xA;$$t = t_\infty \sqrt{1 - \frac{r_\mathrm{S}}{r}},$$&#xA;where $t_\infty$ is the time &quot;at infinity&quot;, i.e. far from the BH, and&#xA;$$r_\mathrm{S} \equiv \frac{2GM}{c^2} \simeq 3\,\mathrm{km}\,\times \left( \frac{M}{M_\odot}\right)$$&#xA;is the so-called Schwarzschild radius (the &quot;surface&quot; of the BH), which is where not even light can escape. Here, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the BH, $c$ is the speed of light, and $M_\odot$ is the mass of the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last equality shows that a BH with the mass of the Sun would have a radius of 3 km. The mass of $\mathrm{BH}_\mathrm{Sgr\,A^*}$ is some 4.1 million Solar masses, so its radius is $r_\mathrm{S} = 12.4$ million km.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Plugging in the other numbers, we can see that at a distance from $\mathrm{BH}_\mathrm{Sgr\,A^*}$ of&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 lightyear&lt;/strong&gt;, time runs slower by a factor of 1.0000006557, i.e. unnoticeably.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 astronomical unit&lt;/strong&gt; (the distance from Earth to the Sun), time runs 17% slower.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 million km from the surface&lt;/strong&gt;, time runs slower by a factor of 3.7.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1000 km from the surface&lt;/strong&gt;, time runs slower by a factor of 111.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 km from the surface&lt;/strong&gt;, time runs slower by a factor of ~3500.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 m from the surface&lt;/strong&gt;, time runs more than a million times slower.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the surface&lt;/strong&gt;, time stops.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that this time dilation is &lt;em&gt;what a distant observer&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. the guy with the $t_\infty$ time) would measure for an observer at the distance $r$. The person at $r$ would just measure his/her own time as usual. For instance, according to point 5 above, if you were hovering 1 km from the surface, waving your hand every second, then I, choosing to stay at a safe distance of 1 lightyear but with a magically powerful telescope, would see you wave approximately once every hour. And when you run out of fuel and plummet into the BH, then when you cross the surface you wouldn't notice anything particular, but I would see you frozen in time. This is the concept of relativity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, let me use this chance to clarify something that people, including myself, often have gotten wrong: &lt;strong&gt;Sagittarius A&lt;/strong&gt; (without an asterisk) is a radio source in the center of the Milky Way. It consists of three parts: &lt;strong&gt;Sagittarius A East&lt;/strong&gt; (a supernova remnant), &lt;strong&gt;Sagittarius A West&lt;/strong&gt; (dust and gas clouds), and &lt;strong&gt;Sagittarius A*&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;Sgr A*&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a very bright and compact radio source believed to be formed by a supermassive BH. Sgr A* isn't actually the BH &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt;. I think the BH doesn't really have a name, so I'll call it $\mathrm{BH}_\mathrm{Sgr\,A^*}$.

At this mass the radiation pressure will be nearly 400 times the gas pressure, justifying the use of a &quot;gas pressure-free&quot; Eddington limit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suspect, though I can't give chapter and verse, that for the intense radiation fields normally associated with the Eddington limit this will always be the case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we are talking about spherical accretion, then because the luminosity is constant at any radius, then the Eddington limit applies to material at any radius. But at greater radii from the central source, for a constant velocity inflow, the density will fall as $r^{-2}$, and the temperature will be lower at large radii. Thus the ratio of radiation to gas pressure will likely &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; with radius and so at some point it will always be appropriate just to consider the radiation pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What this implies is that reaching the Eddington limit could stop the accretion, but that even if it does not (e.g. clumpy accretion), then the increasing gas pressure at smaller radii could limit the accretion if the compressed gas is unable to cool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2531" LastEditorUserId="2531" LastEditDate="2015-05-15T17:20:24.700" LastActivityDate="2015-05-15T17:20:24.700" CommentCount="0" />

Neutrinos decoupled at 1 second after the big bang, filling the universe with neutrinos that should have now cooled to a temperature of about 1.9 K. Confirming this would be a(nother) spectacular validation of the big bang model. However, there is a wrinkle; now that we know neutrinos have mass, it turns out that these neutrinos are non-relativistic at the present epoch. That means they are capable of being diverted and concentrated by gravitational structures - potentially making them fantastic probes of such structure and perhaps more sensitive than photons. So neutrino telescopes would make a fantastic contribution to our understanding of cosmology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neutrinos arise from energetic processes in the cores of stars. These processes are otherwise invisible, we certainly can't see them directly with light and can only probe them indirectly using techniques such as asteroseismology or looking at the mixing of chemical elements from the core to the surface. Neutrinos potentially tell us much more; for instance giving a direct estimate of the number of nuclear reactions taking place per second. Neutrino emission is also the predominant way that cooling takes place in supernovae, and in hot neutron stars and white dwarfs. A neutrino telescope could therefore be fundamental  for a deep (literally) understanding of stellar evolution and particularly the late stages of stellar evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of what can be measured; you can measure the flux of neutrinos and the neutrino energy spectrum.
