Here I have added my machine learning projects.

1. ANN TF Projects contains projects based on tensorflow and ANN on different datasets.
2. ANN KERAS Pojects KERAS based ANN projects.
3. Machine Learning from scratch contains many algorithms of machine learning I have implemented from scratch.
# NN Implementation from scratch with raw python.
* Forward Propagation
* Backward Propagation

# ID3 Implementation from scratch with continuous data split based on entropy and information gain.
* Titanic and irish dataset was used for testing ID3.
* Continuous data spliting based on information gain.
* ID3 Algorithm with recursion. Best attribute was calculated based on information gain.
* Prediction : accuracy,precision,recall reporting.

# Naive Bayes Implementation for text classification.
* Archived data from stack exchange is used for classification.
* Text Preprocessing was done with raw python without nltk.
* Naive Bayes algorithm applied on the proceswed text.
