Here I have added my machine learning projects.

### NN Implementation from scratch with raw python.
* Forward Propagation
* Backward Propagation

### ID3 Implementation from scratch with continuous data split based on entropy and information gain.
* Titanic and irish dataset was used for testing ID3.
* Continuous data spliting based on information gain.
* ID3 Algorithm with recursion. Best attribute was calculated based on information gain.
* Prediction : accuracy,precision,recall reporting.

### Naive Bayes Implementation for text classification.
* Archived data from stack exchange is used for classification.
* Text Preprocessing was done with raw python without nltk.
* Naive Bayes algorithm applied on the proceswed text.
